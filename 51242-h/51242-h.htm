<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In the following pages an attempt is made to give
a clear picture of the part which electricity has
taken and will continue to take in the development
of locomotion.</p>

<p>Some of the aspects of electric traction are highly
technical; others are purely financial. It is impossible
to understand the achievements and possibilities of
electricity in locomotion without a certain amount
of discussion of both these points of view; but it is
not necessary to go deeply into either in order to
catch some of the enthusiasm which inspires the
electrical engineer in his efforts to extend electric
traction everywhere on road and rail. The hopes of
electrical conquest extend, indeed, to locomotion on
the sea and in the air as well as on the land. At the
root of these hopes there lies a firm faith in the
superior economies and flexibility of electricity as
a mode of motion.</p>

<p>In the explanations which are given of electric
tramways, electric railways, electric automobiles,
electric propulsion on ships, and the other phases
of electric traction, nothing but the most elementary
knowledge of electricity is presupposed. A certain
amount of technical description is unavoidable, but
I have restricted it as far as possible to essential
matters which throw light upon the meaning of the
various systems of electric traction and explain the
economic and physical reasons for their adoption.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>


<p>Anyone who glances over the history of electric
traction will be struck by the absence of outstanding
names. There is no man who occupies the same
position in the sphere of electric locomotion as
Watt does in the world of steam, or Stephenson in
the world of railways. As a pioneer, Dr. Wernher
von Siemens perhaps deserves more honour than any
other. But the leading ideas embodied in electric
traction systems were contributed by engineers who
worked in the general field of electrical engineering;
and they have been applied and developed by a
numerous band of men who have added one brick
of experience and ingenuity to another until the
imposing structure was made visible to the world.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I hope the story as told briefly in
the following chapters will not be found devoid of
human interest. It has the advantage, at any rate,
of the attraction which anything pertaining to electricity
holds for all sections of the public. This
attraction deepens upon closer acquaintance with the
mechanism and the history of electricity in action;
and if any of the descriptions and forecasts are found
to be prejudiced in favour of a single instrument of
locomotion, the fault may be considered to rest with
the spell which electricity throws upon everyone who
is concerned in any way with its applications in the
service of man.</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge the kind assistance of
Mr. Frank Broadbent, M.I.E.E., in looking over the
proofs of this volume.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br /><br />

<small>THE WHEEL AND THE PUBLIC</small></h2>


<p>One of the greatest of unknown men of genius
was the inventor of the wheel. Probably&mdash;as in the
case of most inventions&mdash;he shares the credit with
others who prepared the way for him by discovering
that heavy weights could be more easily rolled than
dragged. But, whatever the origin of the wheel and
axle, the combination was so admirable that it
remained unchanged in its essential features for
centuries and still forms the primary element in
locomotion.</p>

<p>Some of the earliest forms of vehicle can be
found co-existing with the very latest. In Oporto,
for instance, there are electric tramways, but there
are also ox wagons which seem to belong to the
childhood of the world. The wheels are rigidly fixed
to rotating axles (the oldest known arrangement) and
the supports of both the front and the back axles are
rigidly fixed to the wagon. The result is that the
vehicle cannot 'steer' and must be dragged round
corners. Some time ago the authorities, realising at
last that this dragging was ruinous to the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
surfaces, made a regulation that all wagons should
have their front axles pivoted. This attempt at
improvement caused more agitation than the Revolution
itself. The owners of wagons argued&mdash;with
perfect justice&mdash;that the rigid wagon had served for
innumerable generations; and they refused, in the
face of fines, to make the change. Their resistance
was so general and so dogged that the law became
a dead letter, and the people reverted with great
content to the ancient system which divided the
business of local transport between yoked oxen and
women who had been trained from girlhood to carry
heavy loads upon their heads.</p>

<p>This example of conservatism, though extreme, is
characteristic of the attitude of the general public
towards innovations in locomotion. Until mechanical
power came to be used, there was&mdash;for many
centuries&mdash;nothing which could be described as a
radical innovation in transport. Roads were multiplied
and improved; some advance was made in the
design and construction of carriages; and the organisation
of posting and stage-coach services was developed.
But little more was done. Compared with these superficial
changes, the idea of using steam power on the
highway or on a railroad was so drastic a change that
it roused tremendous opposition. The railway companies
fought this opposition and overcame it, but
the use of steam carriages on ordinary roads was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
postponed until the appearance of the petrol motor
encouraged a movement&mdash;once more against strong
prejudice&mdash;for the repeal of the legislation which
restricted the use of mechanically-propelled vehicles
on the roads. In a similar way horse tramways
were violently attacked; and their conversion to
electric traction was opposed by a determined
minority in every town. More recently, there was
a vigorous agitation against the substitution of
motor omnibuses for horse omnibuses in London
and elsewhere.</p>

<p>To some extent this recurrent opposition was
reasonable enough. The new forms of locomotion had
dangers of their own; they were generally noisy and
sometimes dirty; and occasionally, as in the case of
early tramways, they were a nuisance to existing
traffic. But it may be noted that electricity claims
to provide a means of locomotion not only more
rapid and more efficient (in most cases) than any
other, but free from many of the drawbacks which
gave conservatism an excuse for opposing the introduction
of steam and other forms of locomotion.</p>

<p>In the following pages I hope to give a clear
account of the achievements of electricity in the field
of locomotion and also to indicate some of its more
immediate potentialities.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br /><br />

<small>EARLY TRAMROADS AND RAILWAYS</small></h2>


<p>It has sometimes been remarked, by unfriendly
critics, that tramways are an apology for bad roads.
That is to say, if road surfaces were perfect, there
would be no need to lay rails in order to allow
vehicles to run easily.</p>

<p>Although this view of the case may be no better
than a quarter-truth, it is justified to the extent that
tramways were, as a matter of fact, the outcome of
an attempt to escape from bad road surfaces. In the
early days of mining, coals were taken by horsedrawn
wagons from the pits to the harbours. The
passage and re-passage of heavy vehicles on the same
roadway led to the formation of deep ruts; and the
first step towards both the tramway and the railway
was taken when logs of wood or 'trams' were laid in
the ruts to facilitate transport.</p>

<p>The next step was to make the upper surface of
the log round and the rims of the wheels hollow, so
that they fitted over the rails and kept the wagons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
on the track. Owing to the upper part of the rails
wearing away quickly, thin plates of iron were in
some cases nailed to them. This improvement led to
the adoption of a cast-iron rail, fastened to wooden
sleepers.</p>

<p>The earliest cast-iron railway was laid down
before the middle of the eighteenth century, about
one hundred years after the first wooden 'tram-ways.'
Half a century later we find the first rail-and-wheel
combination as we know it on modern tramways and
railways, where the wheel carries an inner flange and
runs upon the head of a narrow metal rail. This is
the form which experience has proved to be best
adapted for safety, speed, and economy in power.
The improvements made since the beginning of the
nineteenth century have been in matters of detail.</p>

<p>Many miles of colliery tramroads were in existence
when&mdash;at the beginning of the nineteenth
century&mdash;the idea of using the steam engine in place
of the horse was taken up by engineers. They were
concerned at first solely with the carriage of coal;
the idea of conveying passengers arose at a later
date, after the steam automobile had been tried and
abandoned for the time being. George Stephenson,
for instance, ran his first locomotives on colliery
tramroads; and the first railway&mdash;between Stockton
and Darlington&mdash;was used for passengers merely as
an afterthought. It was, in fact, designed to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
tramroad for the use of the public in general transport
by horse traction.</p>

<p>The most curious feature of this stage in the
evolution of locomotion was that, although Stephenson's
locomotives had been at work for several years and
although several schemes of iron roads had been
projected, very few people had any conception of the
development awaiting the locomotive and iron road
in combination. They did not even appreciate the
proved fact that the locomotive was a more efficient
means of transport than the horse. An immense
amount of pioneering work had to be done before
the impression of a new era could be borne in upon
the public mind. These were the days when the
<i>Quarterly Review</i> backed 'old Father Thames against
the Woolwich Railway for any sum' and when a
witness before a Parliamentary Committee (on the
Liverpool and Manchester Railway Bill, in 1825)
thought himself safe in suggesting that a steam
locomotive could not start against a gale of wind.</p>

<p>When these prejudices were overcome, many years
had to pass before the objections of landowners and
citizens were worn down. Railway engineers spent
most of their time in a form of diplomatic warfare
with opponents to their schemes; huge sums&mdash;part
of which still lingers in the capital accounts of
railway companies&mdash;were spent in Parliamentary
proceedings over Railway Bills. This barren process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
had to be repeated when electric traction made its
appearance; but happily the electrical fight was not
upon quite so extensive a scale, nor was the period of
preparation followed by anything comparable to the
Railway Mania of 1845, when the public made up for
its early contempt of railway enterprise by tumbling
over itself to get shares in some of the most crazy
schemes which were ever put into shape by unscrupulous
company promoters.</p>

<p>The early history of the steam railway is interesting
in connection with electrical locomotion for two
reasons. It shows that the railroad proper evolved
out of the tramroad or 'light railway,' as it would
now be called&mdash;a type of line which is specially suited
to electrical operation. It also includes a controversy
between three modes of traction; and this controversy
forms a very good introduction to a discussion of
the reasons why electricity is so economical in locomotion.</p>

<p>These three modes were (1) stationary engines:
(2) locomotives: (3) the device known as the 'atmospheric
railway.'</p>

<p>In both the first and third, engine houses were
placed close to the line at convenient intervals. In
the first, each steam engine operated an endless rope
to which the train of carriages was attached. The
system is still in use for colliery working and is
also employed (in an improved form, of course) for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
funicular railways. George Stephenson himself employed
it to assist locomotives up heavy gradients.
In the atmospheric railway the stationary engines
were used to exhaust the air from a length of cast-iron
piping laid close to the railway. The principle
is the same as that of the 'pneumatic tube' which
the Post Office uses for sending papers over short
distances. The papers are placed in a cylinder which
fits the interior of the tube; and when the air is
exhausted from the tube in front of the cylinder, the
pressure of the air behind it drives the cylinder
forward.</p>

<p>Nowadays it is difficult to realise that such a
system was seriously proposed for railway work and
actually adopted by an engineer of such eminence as
Brunel. But in point of fact it was recommended by
two Board of Trade experts in 1842 and by a Select
Committee appointed in 1845 to consider several
Bills for atmospheric railways. It was tried at Dalkey
and Croydon, and it was installed under Brunel's
supervision on a six-mile line in Devon. The carrier
in the tube was connected to the train through a
longitudinal slit at the top of the tube. The slit was
closed by a leather flap, except when momentarily
lifted by the passage of the train. A great deal of
ingenuity was exhausted in attempting to make this
'longitudinal valve' efficient, but it was found that
heat, moisture, and frost made the leather deteriorate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
so rapidly as to render it hopelessly ineffective in a
short time. After a series of misfortunes the atmospheric
railway became a mere curiosity in the history
of invention.</p>

<p>Stephenson was right in regarding the atmospheric
railway as 'only the fixed engine and ropes over
again, in another form.' He was also right in his
belief that the steam locomotive was more economical
than either of its rivals. But the stationary engine
idea had the germ of an even sounder principle than
that of the locomotive. Both in electric tramways
and electric railways the power is obtained from
stationary engines. The main difference between the
electric system and the old rope and atmospheric
systems lies in the superior economy with which the
power is conveyed electrically to the trains. There
are other important differences; but the essential
point is that both rope traction and pneumatic propulsion
wasted so much power between the engine
and the train that their other advantages were
annulled, and it was found cheaper to put the engine
on wheels and make it drag itself as well as the
train.</p>

<p>Brunel's reasons for his faith in the atmospheric
railway are well worth quoting for the light they
throw indirectly upon the advantages of electric
traction. He argued that stationary power, if freed
from incumbrances such as the friction and dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
weight of a rope, was superior to locomotive power,
on the following grounds:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A given amount of power may be supplied
by a stationary engine at a less cost than if supplied
by a locomotive.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The dead weight of a locomotive forms a
large proportion of the whole travelling load, and
thus inherently involves a proportionate waste of
power&mdash;a waste which is enhanced by the steepness
of the gradients and the speed of the trains.</p>

<p>Experience has proved the soundness of these
principles. There has been a steady improvement
in the power and efficiency of locomotives, but progress
has reached a point at which further increases
in speed and accelerating power (a very important
matter) are not attainable without a prohibitive
increase in the consumption of coal and a costly
strengthening of the railway track to stand the strain
of heavier engines pounding along at very high
speeds. Electric traction, which is a reversion in
part to the stationary engine system, offers a means
of escape from the limitations of the locomotive.</p>

<p>There is still some doubt in the minds of railway
engineers whether electric traction is really superior
to the steam locomotive on the main railway lines,
where distances are great and train loads heavy.
But the superiority is admitted on suburban lines
and also on tramways, where electricity has almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
completely supplanted both horse and steam traction.
If Brunel had foreseen how economical electricity
would be in the transmission of power between
engine and train, he would have felt still more
confident in his defence of the stationary engine.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br /><br />

<small>THE BIRTH OF ELECTRIC TRACTION</small></h2>


<p>The story of electric traction really begins in the
laboratory of Faraday. He was the first to produce
mechanical rotation by electrical means; and, although
he had no practical end in view, his investigations
produced the germ of the commercial dynamo and
thence of the commercial electric motor.</p>

<p>That germ, however, took about half a century
to develop. It is true that in 1837 (about ten years
after Faraday's discovery) Robert Davidson experimented
with an electric locomotive on the Edinburgh
and Glasgow Railway; it is also true that Jacobi,
two years later, propelled a boat on the Neva with
electric power. But these early attempts were not
on a commercial scale. Not only was the motor a
crude contrivance, but the method of producing the
electric power was hopelessly extravagant.</p>

<p>At that period the 'primary battery'&mdash;similar
in character to those still used for laboratory purposes,
ringing electric bells, and so on&mdash;was the best available
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>source of electricity. Such batteries generate current
by the chemical consumption of zinc. In order to
obtain sufficient power to move a boat, a large number
of batteries had to be coupled together. They were
expensive in first cost, expensive in the zinc which
was their 'fuel'; and they became rapidly exhausted.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="pill">Fig. 1. Diagram to illustrate the essential identity of the dynamo
and the motor. The dynamo generates electricity when the
armature or group of coils is forcibly revolved close to magnets,
thus converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. The
motor causes its armature to revolve forcibly when current is
supplied to it from the dynamo. Thus the motor converts
electrical energy into mechanical energy.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>The essential step towards the commercial plane
was taken when an efficient means was devised for
transforming mechanical into electrical energy on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>large scale. The first 'dynamo-electric' machines,
invented about the middle of last century, were
merely hand machines. Their power was limited by
the strength of the permanent magnets employed in
their construction; and although an increase in power
was obtained by multiplying the number of magnets
and driving by steam power, it was not sufficient for
commercial purposes. In 1867 electro-magnets were
first employed by Siemens and Wheatstone; and
from this application there was developed a machine
whose power as a generator of electricity was limited
only by its size and the speed at which it was run.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary for our present purpose to
enter into the technical details of the modern
electric generator and the modern electric motor.
The principles underlying them are quite simple,
although the theory of their design and the practice
of their construction and operation are almost a
science in themselves. A dynamo or electric generator
is a machine for transforming mechanical into electrical
energy; an electric motor is a machine for
transforming electrical energy into mechanical energy.
If, therefore, we place an electric motor upon a
vehicle and supply it continuously with current from
a dynamo, the motor will rotate and can be used to
propel the vehicle. That is the essential mechanism
of electric traction.</p>

<p>The simplicity of the arrangement is enhanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
by the fact that the dynamo and the motor are
virtually the same machine. In the dynamo, a cylindrical
'armature' of coils is forced to rotate close to
the poles of electro-magnets; the energy exerted in
turning the armature against the influence of the
electro-magnets is transformed into the energy of
electric currents in the coils of the armature. In the
motor, which also consists of an armature close to
the poles of electro-magnets, the process is reversed.
When a current is passed through the coils of the
armature, the reaction between these currents and
the electro-magnets causes the armature to revolve.</p>

<p>This reversibility of the dynamo was, according to
a story frequently repeated, first discovered quite by
accident. In a Paris exhibition a number of Gramme
dynamos&mdash;or dynamo-electric machines, as they were
then called&mdash;were being separately connected to lamps
and other devices for showing the effect of electric
currents; and when one was started up it was
found that another was being <i>driven</i> at a rapid rate.
Investigation showed that the second one had been
coupled up to the first by mistake and was therefore
being worked as a motor by it.</p>

<p>This was in the year 1879; and the story of the
incident served to draw general attention to the
discovery of a new and efficient means of transmitting
power. Engineers recognised that in the steam-driven
dynamo they had the means of producing powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
electric currents, while in the electric motor, connected
by wires to the dynamo, they had the means of reproducing
the power in mechanical form at a distance.
There were, of course, losses of energy in the process.
A certain percentage was lost in the dynamo itself,
some in the transmitting wires, and some in the
motor. But the all-round efficiency of the arrangement
was much higher than that of any other system of
transmitting power from one point to another several
miles distant.</p>

<p>In order to apply this system to propelling
vehicles it was only necessary to devise a continuous
connection between the motor on the vehicle
and the stationary dynamo. This was done on the
first electric railway by means of a 'third rail,'
substantially in the same way as is now familiar on
underground and other electric lines. The third rail
was a metal conductor supported on insulators and
connected to the dynamo. The vehicle or car was
furnished with a metal brush or skate which rubbed
along the third rail as the car moved forward. The
current thus collected was led through the motor
(which drove the axle of the car through toothed
wheels) and thence to the track rails, which conveyed
the current back to the dynamo and so completed
the electrical circuit. Messrs Siemens and Halske
exhibited the first electric railway of this type at
the Berlin Industrial Exhibition of 1879.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Another method of collecting the current was
tried soon afterwards and formed the direct forerunner
of the electric tramway on the now standard
'overhead' system. The disadvantage of the third
rail system is that it involves an exposed 'live'
conductor close to the ground. It is therefore quite
unsuited for use on streets. Consequently the next
step towards the electric tramway was to carry the
electrical conductors overhead by supporting them
on poles erected at the side of the track. The first
installation of this kind was laid down at the Paris
Exhibition of 1881. In that case the conductor was
an iron tube with a slot along its lower side; and
inside the tube was a 'boat' which slid along and
was connected to the car by means of a flexible wire.
A second tube, also with a boat and connecting wire,
was provided to carry the return current. We shall
see later how this arrangement evolved into the
familiar 'trolley' system.</p>

<p>The mention of a slotted tube recalls the atmospheric
system and, in so doing, emphasises the
superiority of the electric system in simplicity, flexibility,
reliability, and economy. Brunel's faith in
the advantages of stationary engines and the transmission
of power therefrom to moving trains would
have been justified by the event if the pneumatic
system of power transmission had been as practicable
as the electric system. But there is an obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
contrast between the huge pipe of the atmospheric
railway, with its impossible 'longitudinal valve,'
and the small tube of the first overhead electric line
or the third rail of the first electric railway. There
is also a pathetic contrast between the prolonged
struggles which Brunel and the inventors of the
atmospheric system underwent before they were
forced to acknowledge failure, and the rapid ease
with which electric traction entered into its kingdom
when the commercial dynamo and motor were first
produced. The intrinsic difficulties which electric
traction engineers had to meet were not serious.
Designers passed, step by step, from the model
electric railway at the Berlin Exhibition to public
lines on a larger scale, and from the model electric
overhead tramway to the 'street railway' or tramway
which gradually supplanted the horse tramway.
Each step consisted in an extension of the distance
covered and an increase in the power required,
coincident with a gradual improvement in the details
of motors, dynamos, and transmission equipment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />

<small>THE ESSENTIAL ADVANTAGES OF ELECTRIC
TRACTION ON TRAMWAYS</small></h2>


<p>A railway journal once committed itself to the
statement that horse traction was superior to electric
traction on roads because the horse possessed the
'vital principle' of energy in its constitution.</p>

<p>It is distinctly curious to find an authority on
locomotion describing the essential drawback of horse
traction as its distinguishing advantage. The 'vital
principle,' unfortunately, needs food and rest to
maintain it not only during working hours but
during the hours of inactivity as well. In actual
practice four horses out of every five in a tramway
stud are in the stables while the fifth is at work.
Moreover, the same stud has to be kept up, at a
practically uniform cost, whether the daily traffic be
light or heavy. Thirdly, the 'vital principle' has
only a limited number of years during which&mdash;apart
from sickness and disease&mdash;it is effective for traction
purposes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p class="pill">Fig. 2. A typical electric tramway on the overhead system.&mdash;The

</div>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<p>Another disadvantage is that the pull which a
horse can actually exercise on a car is strictly limited
and is only a small fraction of the total power
represented by the fodder which the horse consumes.
The strain upon a horse in starting a car or omnibus
is so great that a 'lover of animals' used to supply
London omnibuses with appeals to passengers not to
stop the omnibus more often than was necessary,
especially on an incline. This was a recognition of
the fact that the horse cannot cope easily with the
heavy strain at starting, and that he requires assistance
on heavy gradients.</p>

<p>It was not surprising, therefore, that on horse
tramway systems the speed was low, the cars of
limited capacity, and the fares comparatively high.
The shortness of the journey which a tramway horse
was able to cover without fatigue also tended to
limit the length of routes.</p>

<p>On all these points electric traction was soon
found to be distinctly superior to horse traction.
It was more economical in power; it was able to
maintain higher speeds with larger and more commodious
cars; and there was no narrow limit to the
length of routes or the gradients which could be
surmounted. Consequently electric traction offered
the public an improved service at lower fares.</p>

<p>The whole of the power-producing plant for a
typical electric tramway system is concentrated at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>a generating station placed (if possible) near the
centre of the system. From this station runs a network
of electric mains to feed the lines with current
at convenient points. This concentration is a benefit
on several grounds. A large generating equipment
is cheaper in first cost than a multitude of small power-producing
plants, and it is much more economical in
operation. If every car had its own power equipment,
that equipment would need to be powerful enough to
haul itself and the loaded car up the steepest gradient
on the route. That is to say, the sum of the car capacities
would be equal to the sum of the maximum
demands. But when the power is obtained from a
single stationary source we do away with the dead
weight of the power equipment on the car, and
secure the very vital advantage that the capacity of
the stationary source need not be so great as the
sum of the maximum demands. In actual working it
never happens that all the cars are full of passengers
and ascending the steepest gradients simultaneously.
While some are running up-hill, others are going
down-hill; while some are full, others are half full
or almost empty. The result is that the total
demand for power at any time is always very much
less than the total of the maximum demands made by
each car; and the capacity of the generating station
need be sufficient to cope only with the smaller amount.</p>

<p>This advantage reduces the expenditure necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
upon boilers, engines, and dynamos at the tramway
generating station. And it is enhanced by two
valuable capabilities of the electric motor. The first
is its power of taking a heavy overload for a limited
period without injury. There is no difficulty about
making an electric motor, whose normal capacity is
20 horse power, give 40 horse power momentarily,
30 horse power for several minutes, and 25 horse
power during the best part of an hour. Applied to
tramway work, this advantage means that the rated
capacity of the motor equipment of a car may be less
than what is required to haul a loaded car at an
adequate speed up the steepest gradient on the system.
Such maximum demands, which only occur at intervals
with each car, can be met by the readiness of the
electric motor for overwork. The motors may therefore
be reduced in size, saving money in first cost
and in the current consumed.</p>

<p>The second valuable peculiarity of the electric
motor is that it gives its 'maximum torque' at
starting. That is to say, it exercises the highest
propulsive effort at the precise moment when it is
required. When horses are employed, they have to
endure an abnormal strain in overcoming the inertia
of a stationary vehicle; everyone must have noticed
how horses have to struggle to start a car which
they can keep going at an easy trot once it has got
up speed. The electric motor&mdash;to use an apparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
paradox&mdash;gives this abnormal pull as part of its
normal action. As the inertia of the car is gradually
overcome, the speed of rotation of the motor increases
and its torque decreases, automatically and precisely
in accordance with the demands of the case.</p>

<p>The starting torque of a motor is such an emphatic
phenomenon that the driver of an electric car may,
if he is careless and switches the current on too
suddenly, jerk any standing passenger off his feet,
even though the total weight of the car may be
ten tons or more. Properly employed, however, the
electric motor gives an even and <i>rapid</i> acceleration.</p>

<p>This is a far more important point in tramway
economics than it appears to be at first sight. The
superiority of the electric tramway over the horse
tramway depends less upon higher speed than upon
the fact that less time is wasted in stopping to pick
up and set down passengers. Time is the vital
element in all transport, and it is especially vital in
connection with tramways, which have to stop with
great frequency. If the time which elapses between
putting on the brakes at each stop and getting up to
full speed again can be materially shortened, then
the average speed of the tramway journey can be
materially raised. It is easy, by means of powerful
brakes, to bring a car to rest quickly; the electric
motor enables speed to be regained quickly. In this
way a high average speed may be maintained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
spite of numerous stops; and, with larger cars, the
electric tramway is able to handle a larger volume
of traffic in a shorter space of time than the horse
tramway.</p>

<p>The time lost in stopping is of so much consequence
that, when electric tramways were introduced, the
old custom of stopping the cars at any desired point
was abandoned. Stopping places were arranged at
convenient points along the route, some of them
being regular stops and others optional at a signal
from passengers desiring to alight or to board the
car. The public soon got used to walking a short
distance to a stopping place, although they did not,
perhaps, appreciate how much the collection of traffic
at a reduced number of points tended to improve the
general tramway service.</p>

<p>A high average speed with numerous stops was,
however, only one of the improvements which the
public derived from electric traction. Tramway passengers
expect to find a car not only at a convenient
point but within a convenient period of waiting.
With electric traction the service became much more
frequent than with horse traction. It is quite possible
to run a horse tramway service profitably with
cars at intervals of fifteen to thirty minutes, if the
passengers are patient enough to wait and fill each
vehicle. But with electric traction the main item is
the cost of the standing equipment&mdash;the power house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
mains, and overhead lines&mdash;and unless that equipment
is adequately utilised the revenue will not cover
the standing charges. A fifteen-minute service is,
generally speaking, the lowest economic limit on an
electric tramway. Every tramway manager tries to
attract sufficient passengers for a more frequent
service; and, as a matter of fact, it was found that
where there was sufficient population the provision
of a frequent and rapid service encouraged tramway
travelling so much that cars had to be run at far shorter
intervals than had been customary on horse tramways.</p>

<p>The increase of traffic brought with it the demand
for larger as well as speedier cars with a shorter
'headway' or interval between one car and another.
The capacity of a horse car is limited by the fact
that it is not convenient to harness more than two
horses to a single vehicle. But with electric cars
there is no extraneous limitation to carrying capacity.
Large double-decked cars with seats for seventy
passengers are now quite common. In America it is
a frequent practice to attach 'trailers' to the cars,
making a short tramway train. Experiments have
recently been arranged on similar lines in London,
for the handling of the heavy traffic at rush hours.
These instances show that electric tramway capacity
is flexible and may be adjusted to the density and
the fluctuating character of the demand.</p>

<p>Finally, it falls to be noted that the power con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>sumed
by a tramcar is, roughly, proportional to the
useful work which the car performs. As already
mentioned, it costs about as much to work a horse
tramway when the cars are empty as when they are
full, since the main item is the maintenance of the
'vital principle' of a certain number of horses
independently of the traffic. But with electric traction
the motors require less power when the cars
are running light. And less current for the motors
means less current generated at the power station&mdash;that
is to say, less steam, less oil, less coal, less wear and
tear. If more current is demanded, it is because more
passengers are being carried and more revenue earned.</p>

<p>Reviewing the subject broadly, it is apparent
that the adoption of electric traction on a tramway
is not so much a step in advance as a beneficent
revolution. The higher speeds with more frequent,
more comfortable, and more commodious cars have
created a volume of traffic far beyond what could
have been handled with horse traction. The change
also led to a great increase in the length of tramway
routes and to the construction of new tramway systems.
In 1898, when the electric tramway movement began
in earnest, there were 1064 miles of tramway in the
United Kingdom. Now there are 2562 miles, and the
number of tramway passengers is more than double
the total of third class passengers on the whole
system of British railways. The number of tramway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
passengers carried during 1909-10 (the last period
covered by the published official returns) was equal
to about 62 times the estimated population of the
United Kingdom.</p>

<p>While the traffic has multiplied in this remarkable
fashion, there has been a heavy reduction in the
fares charged. This has been made possible by the
economical features of electric traction. In the old
days a horse tramway had to spend about £80 to
earn £100; an electric tramway need spend only
about £60. With this reduction in the proportion of
expenses to receipts, and with the greater volume of
business, it became feasible to stimulate traffic still
further by giving passengers much longer distances
for their money. In fact, electric traction proved so
economical that people began to imagine that there
was no limit to the reductions which might be made
with financial safety. However, there is plenty of
evidence that a limit exists. In many cases it has
been touched, if not passed, but the public continues
to clamour for all sorts of concessions. These demands
are a great compliment to electric traction,
but they are a decided embarrassment to the tramway
manager who believes in a reasonable margin between
his total expenses and his total revenue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br /><br />

<small>THE MECHANISM OF AN ELECTRIC TRAMCAR:
THE OVERHEAD SYSTEM</small></h2>


<p>A rough idea has already been given of the
elementary mechanism of electric traction&mdash;the combination
of generating station, of cars fitted with
electric motors, and of a sliding contact between the
two. It is in connection with the sliding contact
that the ingenuity of tramway engineers has been
mainly exercised. Three distinct solutions were
evolved for tramway work, giving rise to three
systems&mdash;(1) the overhead or trolley system; (2) the
conduit system; and (3) the surface-contact system.</p>

<p>The first system is now almost universal in the
United Kingdom. Part of the London system is
equipped on the conduit system; and the tramways
at Lincoln and Wolverhampton are constructed on
the surface-contact system. Beyond these cases the
trolley holds the field. In the United States and on
the Continent there is a larger proportion of conduit
work, but from a practical point of view it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>hardly be necessary to mention either conduit or
surface-contact if it were not for the great engineering
interest which they possess and for the controversies
to which they have given rise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>



<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%" >

<div class="caption">
<p class="pill">Fig. 3. Diagrammatic illustration of the general arrangement of an electric tramway on
the overhead system. At the foot is shown the generating station which supplies
alternating current at high-pressure (for economy in transmission) to a sub-station
where it is 'transformed' to low pressure and 'converted' in a motor-generator to
continuous current for distribution to the trolley wire from which each car takes its
current. The course of the current through the trolley pole and controller and
thence to the motors and back by the rails is indicated by arrows.</p>
</div>
</div>




<p>The overhead system has conquered because it is
cheapest in first cost, cheapest to maintain, most
economical in current, and most reliable in action.
Later developments in surface-contact traction have
run it very close on some of these points, but have
not&mdash;for reasons which will be explained&mdash;affected
the established position of the overhead system.</p>

<p>In its essential features the overhead system has
not altered very much from the experimental line
erected at the Paris Exhibition of 1881. The slotted
tube has been replaced by a solid copper wire; and
the 'boat' sliding within it has been replaced by a
wheel or a bow pressed against the lower side of the
wire by means of a pivoted arm controlled by springs.
The sliding bow is common on the Continent, but it
has been adopted on only one British tramway&mdash;that
at Sheerness. Its use for electric traction on railways
will be mentioned later, but as far as British tramways
are concerned the bow is the exception which
proves the trolley wheel rule.</p>

<p>The function of the trolley wheel is to collect
current from the wire along which it rolls. This
current passes through insulated wires down the
trolley arm to the controller, which the driver of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
car operates by means of a handle. The controller,
which is really a series of electrical resistances, is
analogous to a water tap. By its means the current
may be completely shut off from the motors, or
allowed to flow in varying degree as required by the
speed of the car. In starting a car, the driver moves
the controller handle notch by notch, so as to get a
uniform rise in speed until the full current is allowed
to pass through the motors. With such a mechanism,
supplemented by brakes, the driver has the movements
of the car under control.</p>

<p>In a four-wheeled car, each axle is driven by a
motor. In a bogie car (one with a set of four wheels
at each end) the axles of the larger wheels of the
bogie are each driven by a motor; but not directly.
Considerations of space make it necessary to keep the
motor as small as possible, but if a motor is to be
small and also powerful it must rotate at a high speed.
On the tramcar, therefore, the motor drives a small
toothed wheel which drives a large toothed wheel
fixed to the axle, thus effecting a reduction of speed
between the motor and the wheel.</p>

<p>The same considerations of space join with others
in making two motors on each car the general rule.
And the use of two motors enabled the tramway
engineer to introduce a refinement into the method
of control. This refinement is known as the 'series-parallel
system.' One of its objects is to give a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
'starting torque' and so enable the car to gain
speed quickly. When the current is first switched
on by the controller it passes through the motors in
tandem or in 'series,' thus dividing the pressure of
the current (analogous to a 'head' of water) between
them. The starting torque of a tramway motor (or
the turning moment which it exerts when current is
first passed through it) is dependent on the current
but independent of the pressure. Thus the tandem
or 'series' arrangement, which passes the full current
through each motor, gives the maximum starting
torque without an undue consumption of current.
After the car is well started, the next movement of
the controller puts the motors in 'parallel,' opening
up two paths for the current instead of one, so that
each motor receives the full pressure. The practical
result is that there is a very rapid acceleration at
starting, with marked economy in current. If the
motors were kept in 'parallel' right through, twice
as much current would be required to get the same
starting torque. It will be seen later how valuable
this arrangement for getting a rapid start, without
excessive current consumption, may be in improving
the physical and economic conditions of a tramway
or train service.</p>

<p>After having passed through the motors and
done its work, the current is led to the wheels of the
car and returns by way of the rails, which are linked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
together by copper bonds so as to form a continuous
conductor. The passage of the current from the
wheel to the rail is indicated by sparks when the
rails are rough or very dry and dirty. Although the
rails, like the overhead wires, are thus carrying
current, there is no danger of shock from them, as
the electrical pressure in them is only a few volts, at
the outside, while the pressure in the overhead wires
is 500 volts. It is this difference of pressure which&mdash;like
the 'head' of water in a turbine&mdash;supplies the
motive power for the car.</p>

<p>Each car on a tramway system may thus be
regarded as a bridge which completes an electrical
circuit. When the driver moves his controller, current
flows from the generating station at a high pressure,
passes through the controller, operates the motors,
and returns to the generating station at a low pressure.
This typical circuit is completed through every car,
so that the demand on the generating station at any
moment is the sum of the demands of the cars at
that moment. The business of the engineer at the
generating station is to maintain the electrical
pressure in the overhead wire at the normal level
of 500 volts; and in order to do this on an ordinary
tramway system it is found convenient to divide
the overhead wire into half-mile sections, each of
which has a separate main or 'feeder' from the
generating station. The passenger can detect the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
change from one section to another by the click of
the trolley wheel across the gap which insulates
one half-mile section from another. At the same
spot he can see the short square 'feeder-pillar' at
the roadside (containing the switches by which
current can be turned off from that section) and the
cables which pass along the arm of the trolley
standard and terminate in the overhead wire.</p>

<p>On an extensive tramway system the power-supply
arrangements become more complicated. The
central generating station remains the primary source
of power, but sub-stations are erected at convenient
points between the central station and the outskirts
of the tramway area. These sub-stations are secondary
stations for the distribution of electricity. They
receive power at extra-high pressure (5000 volts or
more) from the central station; they contain special
machinery for reducing the pressure to 500 volts for
distribution to the various tramway feeders. The
object of this arrangement is partly technical but
mainly economical. Electric power can be transmitted
at a lower cost in mains and with less loss of
energy at high pressures than at low. Consequently
when the termini of tramway routes are several
miles from the generating centre, greater all-round
efficiency is secured by transmitting current at high
pressure to a number of well selected sub-stations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br /><br />

<small>CONDUIT AND SURFACE-CONTACT TRAMWAY
SYSTEMS</small></h2>


<p>Roughly speaking, the arrangements for generating
electricity, distributing it, and utilising it on
the car, remain the same in conduit tramways and
surface-contact tramways as on the overhead system.
The differences between the three systems are, as
already indicated, confined to the means of collecting
the current for each car.</p>

<p>Both the conduit and the surface-contact system
were suggested as a means of escape from the main
objection to the overhead system&mdash;the exposure of
'live' wires in the street. The cable tramway, with
its concrete trough and slot, gave an obvious hint.
There would be no difficulty, apparently, in carrying
wires on insulators in the trough or conduit, and
utilising the slot for a 'plough' which would slide
along inside the conduit, keeping contact with the
wires, and so conveying the current to the car.</p>

<p>This was tried for the first time in Blackpool,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
where&mdash;in 1884&mdash;a length of conduit tramway was
laid along the front street of the town. The conditions
could hardly have been less favourable for
the system, as the sea frequently washed over the
roadway, flooding the conduit with water and sand.
Further, the conduit was so shallow that children
were able to get at the conductors with their metal
spades. As the conduit carried the return wire, the
effect of a metallic contact between the two conductors
was to cause a 'short circuit,' with very
entertaining fireworks but with no amusing results
for the tramway engineer. After a heroic trial, the
system had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>Bournemouth was the next British town to adopt
the conduit. It did so as a token of its exceptional
civic pride. Three times, in fact, the Bournemouth
Corporation declared that it did not want tramways
of any kind whatever within its gates. And when
the pressure of public opinion forced its consent, the
arrangement was made that no overhead wires
should appear in the central district of the town.
Several miles of conduit tramway were therefore
constructed (the trolley system being used for the
outer tramway routes); and as by that time a good
deal of experience had been gained in conduit work
both in America and on the Continent, the contractors
were able to give the Corporation a conduit
system built to endure. At first the Corporation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
reconciled to the fact that the conduit sections
had cost about twice as much per mile as the trolley
lines, but as years went on, and as the financial
results of the system continued to prove unsatisfactory,
the Corporation's contentment became modified.
An examination of the accounts showed that
the conduit sections could be reconstructed on the
overhead system at a cost equal to the annual
expense of maintaining these sections in good working
order. Since the public had got used to the
overhead wires on the other sections, and since they
had not got used to owning tramways which produced
a heavy loss, the decision was made to abandon the
conduit system altogether.</p>

<p>In London the conduit system was adopted by
the London County Council for various reasons. One
was that the Council felt that London ought to have
the best, the very best, and nothing but the best.
Another was that the streets were so congested with
traffic, lamp standards, telegraph and telephone poles,
and other obstructions, that trolley wires and trolley
standards would be a great nuisance and a serious
danger. Aesthetic reasons were also advanced, but
it is difficult to realise that they had much weight
in connection with the majority of metropolitan streets.
Trolley wires were, in fact, freely erected in suburban
streets where there was a certain amount of beauty
worth preserving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>The main underlying reason, no doubt, was the
feeling that London could afford the most costly
system. In any ordinary city (and perhaps in London
as well) the conduit must be regarded as a luxury.
It involves a continuous road excavation so deep
that a great deal of incidental work has frequently
to be done in moving gas, water, and drain pipes
out of the way. The conduit itself is a thick channel
of concrete, strengthened at intervals of a few feet
with heavy cast iron 'yokes' which support the
'rails' forming the lips of the slot through which
the 'plough' of the car passes. Elaborate arrangements
have to be made for draining the conduit, as
any accumulation of mud or water in contact with
the conductors, or the special insulators supporting
them, would be fatal to the working of the system.
And in practice the ordinary drainage has to be
assisted by continual scraping of the conduit with
special brushes and by repeated flushing during the
hours when the cars are not running. Heavy rains
and snowstorms are therefore liable to upset the
working of the system; and the tramway manager
has to employ quite an army of men simply to keep
the conduit in working order.</p>

<p>Trouble is also apt to be caused by purely mechanical
means. On one occasion a child's hoop fell
through the slot and caused a short circuit. As the
ordinary scrapers slipped over the hoop, its presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>was not detected for a considerable time, during
which the tramway service was at a standstill. Altogether
there is a greater liability to interruption
on the conduit system than on the overhead system.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>



<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%" >

<div class="caption">
<p class="pill1">Fig. 5. The upper portion of the illustration shows a section of a typical conduit system
of electric tramway traction. This section is taken at one of the cast-iron 'yokes'
which support the rails forming the slot through which the 'plough' passes from the
car to make contact with the conductor rails.</p>

<p class="pill2">The lower illustration gives a longitudinal and transverse section of the 'G-B.'
system of surface-contact tramway traction. The rope-like cable carries the current
and is supported on insulators. When the collector on the car covers the stud, the
action of the magnet draws the lower part of the stud into contact with the cable,
thus supplying current to the car. After the car has passed, the lower part of the
stud rises by the action of a spring and, breaking contact with the 'live' cable, becomes
dead. (In actual practice contact would be made under the conditions shown
in the left-hand diagram.)</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Experience of these drawbacks led the London
County Council to seek an alternative to the conduit
when constructing electric lines in the north of London.
Many of the borough councils, following the County
Council's own previous arguments, would not listen
to the suggestion of the overhead system; and a
freshly-elected Council, pledged to a policy of economy,
determined to try the surface-contact system. How
this trial gave rise to a violent political controversy,
leading to the abandonment of the project and culminating
in important libel actions, forms a picturesque
story which need not be told in detail here.
Its main interest lies, for the moment, in the emphasis
which the incidents give to a characteristic of the
surface-contact system&mdash;its sensitiveness to minute
alterations in detail.</p>

<p>The surface-contact or 'stud' system is really a
modification of the conduit system. It has, in fact,
been called the 'closed conduit.' The electric wires
are again placed in a channel or pipe underground,
but instead of being accessible through a slot, contact
can be made with them only through metal studs
placed at intervals flush with the roadway. By special
electro-mechanical devices in the stud and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
car, the stud is brought into contact with the 'live'
underground wire only when the car is over it. That
is to say, the studs covered and protected by the car
will be 'live' and supplying power to the car through
a sliding brush or 'skate,' while those not so protected
will be 'dead' and therefore of no danger to
the public.</p>

<p>An immense amount of ingenuity has been expended
by many engineers in devising studs to act
with absolute certainty under all conditions. In
the laboratory or the workshop, and even on an
experimental track, it was simple enough to arrange
a mechanism which would 'make' and 'break' contact
with admirable regularity. But when it came
to putting the mechanism down on an ordinary roadway,
to be covered with mud, pounded by heavy
traffic, and subjected to the action of damp, frost,
heat, and all sorts of unexpected influences, much
less satisfactory results were obtained. Time and
again the hopes of engineers were dashed by a
succession of petty troubles&mdash;some of them obscure,
most of them unforeseen. The weak points in nearly
all the systems were the insulation of electrical parts
and the road construction work. Lack of simplicity
and rigidity led to the introduction of moisture and
to the shifting of parts so that studs jammed and
remained 'alive' after the car had passed over them.
But even after the practical elimination of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
troubles the success of the surface-contact system
seemed as sensitive as the system itself.</p>

<p>One system was tried at Torquay, and discontinued
after a protracted trial on a large scale. Another
system&mdash;the Lorain system&mdash;was installed at Wolverhampton
and is still in operation, but without
imitators. A third system&mdash;the Griffiths-Bedell or
G-B. system&mdash;was installed in 1905 at Lincoln, with
satisfactory results. It was the G-B. system which
was offered to the metropolitan borough councils as
an alternative to the conduit and the trolley. A
trial section was laid down in 1898 in the Bow Road,
and a certain amount of trouble was experienced
with live studs and with various parts of the equipment.
Owing to the stud system having been suggested
by the Moderate Party, the experimental difficulties
were extensively advertised by members of the
Progressive Party, who condemned the system as
dangerous and unworkable. Public feeling was worked
up to such a pitch that, in the face of expert advice
in favour of the system in a somewhat modified form,
the Council decided to abandon the experiment.
Libel actions by the owners of the 'G-B.' patents
followed, part of the plaintiffs' case being that the
system as laid down was altered in a number of small
but vitally important details by the Council's officers
and was therefore not the 'G-B.' system proper.</p>

<p>The results with the 'G-B.' system at Lincoln<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
prove that it is possible to construct surface-contact
tramways at a cost about 10 per cent. more than that
of trolley tramways, and to operate them, safely and
with reliability, at a cost not appreciably more than
the general working expenses of an overhead line.
But this proof has not only been enfeebled for the
special reasons just described, but it came at a time
when the public had got quite accustomed to the
trolley and also when most towns had already been
equipped with electric traction. Ten or fifteen years
earlier, such a proof might have changed the course
of tramway development; now it can have no great
material effect.</p>

<p>The upshot of the contest between the three
systems has, therefore, been the survival of the one
which was most despised at the outset.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br /><br />

<small>THE BACKWARDNESS OF ELECTRIC TRACTION
IN GREAT BRITAIN</small></h2>


<p>Popular objections to the overhead system are
not, of course, quite dead. Every tramway proposal
in districts where the trolley has not already penetrated
is still opposed on the ground of disfigurement
and danger. This opposition serves as an index to
the severity of the struggle which the advocates of
the trolley system had to encounter before they made
it almost universal in large cities. But the dislike
of the public for a questionable novelty was not
the sole reason why electric tramway enterprise was
backward in Great Britain.</p>

<p>It is not strictly accurate to say that electric
tramway <i>enterprise</i> was backward. The enterprise
was there, in spirit, but circumstances were very
much against it. Tramway schemes are controlled
by special legislation which was passed before electric
traction was contemplated; and this legislation has
not been amended in any material degree to suit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the altered conditions brought about by the use of
electricity.</p>

<p>The Tramways Act, 1870&mdash;which is the master
Act of the situation&mdash;was framed at a time of reaction
against public monopolies. Before that time, gas,
water, railway, and other companies had been granted
statutory powers in perpetuity; and when a local
authority wanted to take the supply of gas or water
into its own hands, it had to buy the existing undertakings
at the valuation put upon them by the owners
themselves. There were frequent complaints about
excessive purchase terms, and also about extortionate
rates charged by the monopolist companies. Consequently,
when horse tramways came on the scene,
the legislature determined to put the new 'monopoly'
on quite a different basis. The Tramways Act provided,
first, that no application for tramway powers would
be so much as considered if it did not gain the consent
of the local authorities interested; second, that the
period of tenure should be limited to twenty-one
years; and third, that the local authorities should
have the option, at the end of the period or at seven-year
intervals afterwards, of buying the tramway
undertaking at the 'then value' of the plant (rails,
horses, cars, depots, etc.) without any allowance for
compulsory purchase, goodwill, future profits or any
other consideration whatsoever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>This Act was passed with the very best of intentions.
It had the advantage of substituting, for the
costly and clumsy procedure by Private Bill, the
simple and cheap process of applying to the Board of
Trade for a 'Provisional Order' which would acquire
the full force of an Act when ratified (in a more or
less automatic way) by Parliament. But in spite of
its good intentions it proved a serious stumbling-block,
especially when electric traction was proposed.</p>

<p>The effect of the limited tenure system, with
compulsory expropriation on what were called 'scrap-iron'
terms, was to make the companies very reluctant
to spend one penny more than was absolutely necessary
during the concluding years. Capital expenditure
on improvements in equipment was regarded as out
of the question, since there was not sufficient time to
recoup the difference between first cost and the 'then
value' at the purchase period. Money was grudged
for the upkeep of track, the repair and painting of
cars, and the hundred and one items of expense
which are essential to a well-conducted tramway.
System after system fell into a state of shabby gentility,
hoarding money against its inevitable end.</p>

<p>This was the condition when, in the middle eighties,
electric traction was suggested. The public, suffering
from the decay of the tramway service, but not realising
that the cause lay with an Act devised for the public
benefit, expected the tramway companies to adopt
the new mode of propulsion. But as the conversion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
to electric working involved track-work costing several
thousands of pounds per mile, and new cars costing
several hundreds each, together with a large generating
plant and new car depots, the change was commercially
impossible to companies which were forced
to retain their old horse equipment in order to realise
something for the shareholders in the day of expropriation.
From these causes there arose a demand
that the municipalities should take over the tramway
systems and do what the companies appeared too
slow to undertake.</p>

<p>Thus a strong impetus was given to municipal
tramway enterprise. But this impetus did not remove
the causes of delay. The local authorities had good
economic reasons for waiting until the existing tramway
leases ran out and so enabled purchase to be made
upon the most advantageous terms. They were also
obliged to move very cautiously in adopting so radical
and so novel a change as electric traction. Municipalities
are not speculative traders, who are ready to
take risks after a rapid expert investigation of a new
policy. Further, no municipality likes to accept the
decision of another as valid for its own district.</p>

<p>The consequence was that each municipality
thought it necessary to get its own expert report on
the subject and, in many cases, to send its own deputation
to inspect Continental tramway systems. These
preliminary studies, with debates in Council chambers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and newspaper columns, with public meetings of
encouragement or protest, and with the erection of
experimental lines, took up so much time that little
of a substantial nature was done until several years
after engineers were ready and willing to carry out
the conversion of large systems of horse tramways
to electric working.</p>

<p>The municipalities, however, were not the only
forces at work. Towards the year 1896, when a
large number of tramway leases were running out,
a considerable amount of business was done by private
capital in buying up horse tramways with a view to
conversion and also to extension far beyond the
limits of the existing routes. The essential condition
of the success of such enterprise was, of course, the
renewal of the tenure of the tramways for at least
another twenty-one years. Here&mdash;and in the accompanying
applications for extensions of route&mdash;the
true inwardness of the Tramways Act was shown.
Everything was in the hands of the local authorities.
They had only to withhold their consent, and nothing
could be done. And this power of veto enabled them
to drive any bargain they pleased with the promoters
of tramway schemes.</p>

<p>Most electric tramway proposals covered the
areas of several local authorities, so that negotiations
had to be entered into with each in turn. The
municipalities, being the guardians of the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
interests, considered it their duty to impose the
heaviest conditions which the promoters could be
induced to accept, rather than abandon the enterprise.
It was a case of Hobson's choice in every parish. In
some instances direct payments for wayleaves were
demanded. In others the promoters were forced to
bear the cost of street widenings and other 'public
improvements' which were not always necessary for
tramway purposes. In nearly every town the fares
and stages were determined by the local authority&mdash;on
the strength of the veto, not on commercial
principles. The cost of construction was frequently
increased by onerous conditions regarding the standard
of overhead wire and track work. Under the
Tramways Act, tramway companies were compelled
to maintain the roadway between the rails and also
outside for a space of eighteen inches&mdash;a provision
which was sensible enough when horses were used.
But the condition was not only enforced within these
statutory limits when the promoters were about to
use a form of traction which spared the road surface;
it was extended in numerous cases to an obligation
to pave the entire roadway and to maintain it&mdash;often
with expensive wood paving where macadam had
previously been considered quite good enough for
the traffic.</p>

<p>One effect of this state of affairs was delay. The
preliminary negotiations with local authorities&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
interviews with mayors, aldermen, councillors, town
clerks, and borough surveyors, to say nothing of the
'frontagers' along the line of route&mdash;usually occupied
far more time than the actual construction of the
tramways. They were also much more troublesome,
since it was within the power of a single local authority
in a central position to 'hold up' a complete scheme,
while most districts had strong local patriotism and
wanted a municipal system to themselves. Very little
is known by the general public of the anxiety,
difficulty, and expense attending such negotiations
with local bodies divided into parties or cliques and
furnished with an absolute power of veto. Looking
back on the history of electric traction, it really
seems extraordinary that engineers and financiers
had the patience to undertake this work and carry
it through. Their reward, as will be seen, was not
great in a pecuniary sense; and, as regards reputation,
they are generally accused of being extravagant,
avaricious, and wanting in enterprise.</p>

<p>The ultimate effect was that the actual cost of
electric tramways exceeded the estimates prepared
on the basis of Continental and American experience.
The more prolonged and difficult the negotiations
preliminary to a scheme became, the greater the expense.
And the conditions imposed by local authorities
as the price of their consent loaded the capital account
of electric tramway undertakings with items which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
had no direct concern with the tramway. The Board
of Trade assisted the increase in cost by prescribing
a standard of construction which was higher than
that allowed in other countries. The net result has
been that while electric tramways were expected to
cost about £9500 per mile, they have actually cost
over £12,000 per mile.</p>

<p>The revenue side of the account has also been
affected by the power of veto. A local authority has
no hesitation in imposing low fares and long stages
(with high wages and short hours for employees) upon
a tramway company seeking its consent. The standard
usually adopted is that of large urban systems with
dense traffic, so that systems in scattered districts
are often unfairly treated. In municipal systems
themselves the fares are apt to be determined by
the promises of councillors at election times rather
than by the simple consideration of a fair price
for improved traffic facilities. Workmen's fares, for
instance, are a dead loss on practically every tramway
system. Every now and again there is an agitation
for halfpenny fares, for the extension of stages, for
cheap rates for school children, for free transport for
the blind, and so on. A leading municipal tramway
manager once remarked that it was almost impossible
for men in his position to resist the pressure for such
concessions, especially at local election periods. The
chairman of the Highways Committee of the London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
County Council recently stated that never a day
passes without some appeal for concessions in tramway
fares.</p>

<p>Most of the large urban systems are under municipal
control, and therefore they have the rates in
reserve, as well as the most favourable traffic conditions,
to encourage them in giving the public more
and more for less money. But the tramway companies,
working for the greater part in less thickly populated
areas, with no extraneous means of making up losses,
are put in a difficult position when similar concessions
are forced upon them. The upshot is that the average
return on the capital of electric traction companies
amounts to only 3·41 per cent. Better profits were,
in fact, made in the horse tramway days; and the
electric traction industry is a fine example of the way
in which the enterprise of engineers and capitalists
may bring little comfort to themselves but enormous
benefit to the public, which shows its gratitude by
asking for greater blessings at their expense.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br /><br />

<small>ELECTRIC TRAMWAY STAGNATION.
THE TROLLEY OMNIBUS</small></h2>


<p>The revenue of a tramway is built up of pennies;
and a minute increase in the average earnings per
passenger will therefore have a large effect on the
total receipts. For instance, it was calculated (in
1907) that an increase of one-tenth of a penny in the
average fare on the sixty systems under the control
of the British Electric Traction Company would
mean an increase of over £200,000 in the revenue.
Similarly, a fractional decrease in one of the operating
expenses&mdash;say, the cost of electric current&mdash;might
transform a shaky undertaking into a sound
one. Tramway finance, in fact, is a question of infinitesimals.</p>

<p>So long as fares are determined by arbitrary
conditions, little can be done to increase the revenue
on an electric tramway system. Such matters as the
weather and the extent of building operations have
far more influence on tramway traffic than anything
the tramway manager can do to assist it. Apart
from the development of parcels traffic, his best
opportunities lie in the skilful adjustment of the
service to the varying needs of the public, so that
the 'rush' hours find an adequate supply of cars,
while the quieter hours find no 'waste car mileage'
in the form of empty cars. He can also do a good
deal in the way of inducing the drivers not to waste
current. By putting an electricity meter on each
car it is possible to check the current consumption
and, by a system of bonuses, to encourage the
economical driver. There are many other directions
in which small financial leakages may be arrested,
giving an aggregate saving which is well worth the
trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>



<p>The fact remains, however, that on the whole the
electric tramway business depends upon too narrow
a margin between costs and receipts. The recognition
of this fact, coupled with the legislative difficulties
already described, led to the practical cessation of
tramway development in Great Britain at a point far
short of what was once expected. At one stage, no
doubt, people were a little too enthusiastic about
electric traction. They imagined that electric traction
would create profitable traffic along the most deserted
of side streets. Acting on that theory, municipalities
constructed&mdash;or forced tramway companies to construct&mdash;lines
along roads which could never supply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>enough traffic to justify the expenditure involved.
The interest on capital and other standing charges
for an electric tramway route are so substantial that
a certain minimum of traffic density must exist
before any profit at all can be earned.</p>

<p>However, after every allowance is made for such
local excesses of enthusiasm, the under-developed
condition of electric traction in Great Britain remains
conspicuous enough. A sensible relaxation of legislative
restrictions would go a long way to improve
matters&mdash;if, that is to say, financiers could be induced
to re-enter a field in which they have had many
disappointments.</p>

<p>Great hopes of improvement were entertained
when the Light Railways Act, 1896, was passed. The
primary object of this Act was to encourage the
building of cheap railways for agricultural and fishery
purposes, but it was drafted on lines broad enough
to include electric tramways. Arrangements were
made for State and local contributions to the cost of
such schemes, in cases where subsidies appeared to be
justifiable. The procedure in obtaining powers was
made as simple and as economical as possible.
Applications for 'Light Railway Orders' had to be
made to the Light Railway Commission, one of whose
members then arranged to hold a local inquiry into
the proposal. If sanctioned, the scheme was passed
on to the Board of Trade for approval, and the Order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
if confirmed, thus secured the validity of a Private
Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>Nothing was said in this Act about the consent of
local authorities, or about limited tenure, or about
expropriation upon scrap-iron terms. But the Light
Railway Commissioners chose to interpret the Act
in terms of the Tramways Act, with the result that,
when there was any opposition on the part of local
authorities, the tramway promoter using the Light
Railways Act was not much better off than before.
He had to face a new difficulty in a clause of
the Light Railways Act, which provided that when
the proposed light railway was of sufficient magnitude
and in such a position that it offered competition
with an existing railway, the scheme should be
submitted to Parliament as a Private Bill&mdash;that is
to say, should face the most costly and cumbersome
procedure of all.</p>

<p>The Light Railways Act thus proved a great
disappointment. Its failure to afford relief seems to
have taken away the tramway promoter's last hope
of genuine legislative betterment. He has resigned
himself to things as they are; and the utmost he
does is to assert, when occasion offers, that there are
many districts which might enjoy the benefits of
electric traction if means were provided for bringing
every scheme directly before an independent tribunal
for consideration on its merits alone; if arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
were made for obtaining wayleaves and land on favourable
terms, and if he were allowed to construct
and equip the line on a less costly basis than the
Board of Trade now demands, even in rural districts.</p>

<p>Pending that revolution, tramway authorities are
seeking to develop a cheaper means of electric traction
than the tramway. At the present stage, urban tramways
have spread through suburbs towards villages
and small towns which are anxious for better transport
facilities but have not sufficient population to
justify a tramway extension. Inter-urban tramway
systems&mdash;those connecting towns with a network of
lines&mdash;are also adjacent to such minor centres of
traffic. From time to time attempts have been made
to meet the demand by means of petrol omnibuses,
but they have rarely been successful&mdash;partly, no
doubt, owing to the difficulty of working a limited
petrol omnibus service economically at the extremities
of an electric tramway system.</p>

<p>The latest solution of the problem is the 'trackless
trolley' or, more correctly, the 'trolley omnibus.' In
the 1911 session over a dozen tramway authorities
applied for powers to use this device; and, if the
financial results of the first attempts are successful,
there will probably be a considerable growth in this
type of electric traction.</p>

<p>The trolley omnibus is a hybrid between the
trolley tramcar and the omnibus. It is akin to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
first, because it derives its power from an overhead
wire through a flexible trolley pole. It is akin to
the second, because it does not run on rails but is
fitted with solid rubber tyres and uses the surface of
the road in the usual way.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, its electrical equipment is
similar to that of a tramcar. The trolley pole conveys
the electric current to the controller, which
admits it to motors geared on to the back axles.
There are, however, one or two important differences.
The absence of a rail which might act as a return
conductor necessitates the provision of a second
overhead wire and a second trolley-pole to connect
with it. Thus the electrical circuit is from the
power station, along the first overhead wire, down
the first trolley-pole, through the controller and
motors, up the second trolley-pole, and back by the
second overhead wire to the power station. Owing
to the vehicle being a steerable one, the trolley-poles
have to be specially designed to give plenty of free
play sideways. The vehicle itself is similar in appearance
to a single-decked motor omnibus, and it
runs on solid rubber tyres or spring wheels.</p>

<p>The first thing which strikes one about the trolley
omnibus in comparison with the electric tramcar is
the cheapness in first cost. All the expense of
concrete foundations, heavy rails, and granite paving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>is avoided. On ordinary roads the overhead construction
is much less costly, as a single line of poles
supporting two wires is sufficient for the up and
down services. Estimates show that the equipment
of a mile of roadway on this system will cost only
from one-fourth to one-third of the corresponding
tramway system. Following on this economy there
is the saving in the cost of maintenance and repairs&mdash;a
serious item on the ordinary tramway. In actual
working, the system has the advantage that the
vehicles can steer past slow-going traffic, thus avoiding
the delay caused on tramway systems through
carts having to draw out, away from the track, when
overtaken by cars. This steering or 'overtaking'
power enables a trolley omnibus service to be
maintained without obstruction on a narrow roadway
which would be badly congested by tramcars running
on a rigid track. When there is only one pair of
wires, two trolley omnibuses may pass each other
(whether going in the same or opposite directions)
by the simple process of pulling down the trolley
poles of one car and swinging them out of the way
for a few seconds. On a single-line tramway it is
necessary to provide loops at intervals for crossing
purposes and also to arrange the service so that cars
arrive at the loops simultaneously.</p>

<p>The other side of the picture is shown when we
come to look into the costs of working.</p>

<p>No matter how good the road surface may be or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
how excellent the design of the wheel, the tractive
effort required for a trolley omnibus must be
relatively greater than that required for a tramcar.
Nothing demands a lower tractive effort than a steel
wheel running on a steel rail. Consequently the
trolley omnibus takes more power per ton moved
than the tramcar. When the road surface is wet or
uneven, or muddy or loose, this difference is of course
multiplied. Another addition to the working cost is
produced by the tyres, which, if of rubber, may wear
away at the rate of 1-1/2<i>d.</i> or 2<i>d.</i> per mile per vehicle.
Owing to the uniform control of speed afforded by
the electric system, there is less jerking at starting
or stopping than is general with a petrol-driven
omnibus; but in spite of that advantage, tyre wear
on a trolley omnibus must remain an important item.
Something must also be allowed for the effect of
vibration upon the car body and electrical equipment&mdash;an
effect which is of course much less
pronounced when a vehicle runs on rails.</p>

<p>The balance between these advantages and disadvantages
is not easy to strike, even on a general
basis. And it varies so much under local conditions
that tramway engineers debated a long time before
they decided in certain cases to try the trolley
omnibus in extending their traffic facilities. All
they had to go upon was the experience gained on
certain Continental routes, where trolley omnibuses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
have been running for several years. That experience
encouraged the hope that trolley omnibuses might
be a profitable means of developing traffic in conjunction
with a tramway system, and along routes
which would not provide sufficient business for a
regular tramway.</p>

<p>The simultaneous adoption of the trolley omnibus
on a number of tramway 'feeders' gave rise to an
impression that tramway authorities had discovered
the wheel-on-rail system to be less efficient than the
tyre-on-road system. As a general proposition,
nothing could be further from the truth. Tramway
authorities have adopted the new system in certain
cases where the possible traffic is comparatively
small, not as a substitute for tramways, but as an
alternative to self-propelled omnibuses. The carrying
capacity of a trolley omnibus is about twenty, while
that of a tramcar is frequently as high as seventy.
The speed of a tramcar runs up to twenty miles an
hour, while twelve miles an hour is as much as is
comfortable (to say the least) with a vehicle running
with solid tyres on an ordinary road.</p>

<p>Therefore, where large volumes of traffic have to
be handled swiftly, the tramway will remain. But
where a twenty-minute or half-hourly service of
small vehicles is sufficient for the available passengers,
a system which is much cheaper in first cost is clearly
more suitable, even though it may not reach the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>standard of economy in working set by the large
urban tramway. That is to say, the choice between
the two systems depends entirely upon local circumstances.</p>

</div>



<p>As an emphasis upon this statement, it is significant
that many tramway engineers regard the trolley
omnibus merely as the forerunner of a tramway.
For this reason they favour the adoption of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>particular trolley omnibus system where the overhead
equipment is adaptable with trifling changes to
tramway purposes. They argue that, in the case of
a village of a few thousand inhabitants, situated a
mile or so beyond the terminus of a tramway route,
a trolley omnibus service will not only be sufficient
for the existing traffic, but will show whether the
traffic is likely to increase (through the stimulation
of building enterprise) up to the point where it would
make the laying of rails worth while. When that
point is reached, the rails will be laid and the trolley
omnibus vehicles put on some other route which is
at one and the same time a tramway 'feeder' and
a tramway 'feeler.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br /><br />

<small>REGENERATIVE CONTROL</small></h2>


<p>Before going on to discuss the 'accumulator' or
'storage battery' system of electric traction, reference
should be made to an invention which holds the germ
of great economies in electric traction. This invention
is known under the name of 'regenerative control.'</p>

<p>It has already been explained that the dynamo is
reversible&mdash;that is to say, a dynamo may act as a
motor, or a motor as a dynamo. This fact is usefully
applied in braking tramcars. When a car has gained
speed, its momentum represents a certain amount of
stored energy. In stopping the car, this energy has
to be absorbed or dissipated in some way or other.
One method is to utilise the friction of brake blocks
on the wheels, or of skids on the rails themselves.
With the electric car, however, it is possible to absorb
the energy by making it drive the motors as if they
were dynamos. The moving car drives the wheels,
which in turn drive the motors; and the current so
generated may either be absorbed in electrical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
'resistances' or led to electro-magnets which are so
placed that they exercise a retarding pull on the rails.
In any of these cases a car which is being stopped,
or is being 'held back' by the brakes when going
down-hill, is wasting power. It is clear, therefore,
that a great deal of power could be saved if the
current generated by the motors in retarding could
be pumped back, as it were, into the electrical
circuit.</p>

<p>This is the problem of 'regeneration' which has
fascinated many electrical engineers. The practical
difficulties underlying it are very great; and perhaps
the only man to get within measurable distance of
surmounting them was Mr J. S. Raworth, whose
system of regenerative control was tried on a number
of tramway systems and installed on the Rawstenstall
tramways in 1909. It cannot be said with confidence
that all the difficulties have been overcome; on the
other hand, it would be rash to say that they are
insurmountable. Mr Raworth, at any rate, retains
his faith in ultimate victory; and the theoretical
beauty of the system is so complete that it is bound
to retain its fascination.</p>

<p>The practical result of regeneration is to eliminate
the effect of hills. A regenerative car in descending
a hill gives back to the generating station some of
the excess energy required to take it up the hill. In
the same way each car, in coming to a standstill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
gives back a portion of the energy required to start
it. A regenerative tramway may thus be represented,
from the energy point of view, as one in which all the
cars are running at normal speeds on level roads.</p>

<p>Incidentally the regenerative system gives a very
perfect control of the speed of the car on all gradients,
owing to the regeneration which begins automatically
when the motors start 'coasting.' It is a power-saver
and a brake in one; and its efficacy as a means of
control is so great that, if its incidental drawbacks
could be avoided, it would be worth adopting for this
purpose alone, both on electric tramways and on
electric railways.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br /><br />

<small>ACCUMULATOR ELECTRIC TRACTION.<br />
THE ELECTRIC AUTOMOBILE</small></h2>


<p>The use of the accumulator or storage battery in
electric traction affords a very good example of how
a means of propulsion may fail in one set of circumstances
and contrive to succeed in another. Its
history serves to remind us that the problem of
cheap transport is really a group of problems, each
one of which demands a particular solution.</p>

<p>The accumulator is a device for storing electrical
energy in the form of chemical energy. Its action
depends upon the effect of currents of electricity on
lead plates in a bath of sulphuric acid. The passage
of the current through the battery produces chemical
changes which enable the battery to give out current
when required. As the battery may remain 'charged'
for several days, and may be discharged slowly or
quickly, it provides a means of 'storing' electrical
energy. In practice, and under favourable conditions,
the efficiency of the storage battery is about 80 per
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>cent. That is to say, there is a loss of about 20 per
cent. in the process of conversion and re-conversion.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%" >
<img src="images/071.jpg" alt="Electric automobile" style="width: 80%" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="pill">Fig. 8. A modern electric automobile.&mdash;The electric battery is
placed under the front half of the car, and the motors drive the
back axle through chains. (British Electric Automobile Co., Ltd.)</p>
</div>
</div>



<p>Great hopes were once entertained of accumulator
traction on tramways. The storage battery offered
a means of escape from all the difficulty and expense
of carrying electric mains overhead or underground.
By fitting each car with a storage battery, it could
be made an independent self-contained locomotive,
capable of running a certain number of miles until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>the battery was approaching exhaustion. By providing
centres where the batteries could be re-charged&mdash;or,
to save time, replaced by batteries previously
charged&mdash;a continuous service could be maintained
on a tramway system.</p>

<p>The advantages of accumulator traction, apart
from the saving in first cost, are the absence of
obstruction and danger from overhead wires, and of
the risk of a general stoppage of the service when
the current at the generating station fails from any
accidental cause. When accumulators are used, the
conversion of a horse tramway to an electric tramway
becomes a very simple matter. All that is required
is to erect a generating station and provide each car
with a storage battery and electrical equipment. This
equipment, it may be mentioned, is substantially the
same as with ordinary electric cars. The current
flows from the accumulator through the controller
and the motors back to the accumulator.</p>

<p>Many trials were made with this system in the
early days of electric traction, but there are no survivals.
The failures were due in part to weaknesses in
the batteries and to the difficulty of handling them with
proper care under the rough and ready conditions
of tramway service. The main cause, however, was
the inherent drawback of all locomotive systems&mdash;the
fact that the tractor has to haul its own dead
weight in addition to the weight of the car and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
passengers. Lead being one of the heaviest of metals,
this dead weight was a very serious item on accumulator
tramcars. It proved to be a fatal item when
the attempt was made to run large cars on heavy
gradients. The rush of current demanded in starting
such cars up-hill was in itself too severe a tax on the
delicate structure of the batteries. In practice,
moreover, the necessity of bringing each car back to
the depot for re-charging, after a limited journey,
proved very troublesome. The more extensive the
system and the more frequent the service, the more
troublesome this necessity became. Even the most
enthusiastic advocate of the storage battery was at
last forced to admit that it was not applicable to a
system of transport, which demanded comparatively
high speeds with large cars on all gradients and over
a range of several miles from the centre of power.</p>

<p>After the admitted failure of accumulator tramways,
the storage battery was for some time used
only on river launches and small private vehicles.
The conditions in both cases&mdash;and especially in the
former&mdash;are very favourable to its operation. On a
river launch the weight of the battery is not a serious
item, as it serves to some extent in the place of
ballast. Launches, moreover, are generally required
for trips of a limited number of miles up and down
the river from the boathouse or charging station of
the owner. In contrast with the tramway, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
no demand for rapid acceleration at starting or for
abnormal power at intervals. The batteries discharge
slowly and fairly evenly, and are not subjected to
serious vibration. The electrical equipment is extremely
simple, as the motor is fixed on to the
propeller shaft and operated by a controller on the
deck close to the steering wheel.</p>

<p>However, if economy were the only consideration,
it is doubtful whether the electric launch would have
survived against the competition of steam and petrol
launches. It has survived because the simplicity of
the equipment, its silent running, and the absence of
heat, smoke and fumes, make it the ideal thing for
river work. The hire of an electric launch on the
Thames costs more than that of a steam launch, but
plenty of people are willing to pay the additional
charge to avoid the drawbacks of steam propulsion
on a small vessel.</p>

<p>Similar considerations underlie the extensive use
of electric broughams in cities. Such vehicles are
required only for travel within a restricted area and
on streets where the gradients are seldom severe.
Their carrying capacity is generally limited to two or
four passengers, so that the batteries do not require
to be unduly heavy. A maximum speed of 12 miles
an hour is quite sufficient for city streets; and
with careful treatment the batteries can be very
economically used and will not deteriorate nearly so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
rapidly as they would under tramway conditions. Considerations
of economy, on the other hand, do not
weigh very heavily with the class of people who use
private electric broughams. They are prepared to
pay for the best available; and the electric brougham,
with its noiselessness, its easy running, its absence of
smell or other nuisance, is regarded as the ideal
which other modes of city transport must do their
best to approach.</p>

<p>In London a certain amount of business has been
done for some years in hiring electric broughams
for various periods on terms which include current,
maintenance, garage facilities, driver's wages, and
all other charges. The convenience of such an arrangement
to the hirer need not be emphasised, since
what is wanted in this case is a vehicle which is
always ready at a telephone call. But the system
has another important advantage, which bears upon
the economic prospects of accumulator traction. By
retaining the vehicles under its control the hiring
company not only centralises the arrangements for
storing and re-charging, but it is able to take care
that the batteries are properly treated. Just as the
success of the surface-contact system depends on
minutiae of design, so the success of accumulator
traction depends upon minutiae of treatment. Carelessness
in driving the vehicles and in handling the
batteries at the garage may transform a perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
satisfactory mode of city transport into an extravagant
nuisance. Consequently the success of this class of
business depends upon an organisation which permits
of constant supervision over every vehicle and every
driver.</p>

<p>A good deal of ingenuity has been exercised upon
the electrical equipment of broughams; and it is
probable that further improvements will be made.
In some cases the front axle is driven by the motor;
in some cases the back axle. The earliest cars used
toothed-wheel gearing in order to reduce the speed
of the small fast-running motor. Improved types on
this principle still exist, but there are some interesting
forms in which the motors are placed right at the
hub of the wheels and effect speed reduction and
control by electrical means, without any intermediate
gearing.</p>

<p>In addition to these improvements, the storage
battery itself has made a distinct advance in design
and construction. It is more efficient, more durable,
and more reliable now than ever it was before. The
closer attention given to its treatment tends in the
same direction; and the result is that storage-battery
makers and engineers have a very accurate knowledge
of what the accumulator will do at a certain cost
under certain conditions. The conditions being the
variable factors in the problem, and being in large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>measure determinable by choice, it is rather remarkable
that the engineers and financiers should have
selected, at the outset, the very conditions which were
least suited to the peculiarities of the accumulator.</p>

<p>The attempt to adapt battery traction to tramway
work is a conspicuous case in point, but it is not
perhaps so conspicuous in the public memory as the
efforts to organise electric cab and electric omnibus
services in London and elsewhere. These efforts
have been made so often and failed so regularly that
they have made it difficult to obtain capital for any
form of electric battery propulsion.</p>

<p>The electric omnibus has many of the drawbacks
of the storage-battery tramcar, but they are not so
serious in the case of an urban service, adequately
met by small cars running at moderate speeds on
short routes with moderate gradients. It is possible
that if recent metropolitan electric omnibus enterprises
had been as happy in their finance as in their
engineering, they would have succeeded well enough.
But even in their engineering they had to meet
great difficulties. They sought to protect themselves
against excessive costs by entering into maintenance
agreements with the makers of the batteries; and
although the terms of these agreements were satisfactory
enough, their validity depended on careful
treatment of the batteries by the drivers of the cars&mdash;a
matter which it is rather difficult to guarantee.
Moreover, the number of omnibuses put on the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
was so small that the garage costs and other standing
charges were proportionally very heavy. With a
larger fleet and with efficient organisation, much
better results might have been achieved in spite of
the inherent difficulties of the situation.</p>

<p>Although the electric cab has the advantage of
being a smaller vehicle and therefore more adapted
to economical propulsion by storage batteries, the
conditions of the cab service are not at all favourable
to the system. The essential feature of a cab is that
it should be available anywhere, to go anywhere at
a moment's notice. An accumulator-driven vehicle,
on the other hand, is tied by an invisible cord to the
charging station. Even if charging stations were
multiplied enormously, the electric cab would have
no real freedom of action, since several hours are
required for the process of re-charging. We have
only to compare the limitations of the electric cab
with the freedom of the petrol cab (which can renew
its supply of petrol in a minute or two at any motor
depot) to realise that the roving commission is not at
all suited to the former.</p>

<p>In 1899 a very bold effort was made to establish
an electric cab service in London. To inaugurate
the service a procession of the cabs was formed, but
it excited more ridicule than serious interest. The
clumsy appearance of the cabs was against them;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>and their behaviour was not satisfactory enough&mdash;as
to speed and reliability&mdash;to overcome the first
unfavourable impressions. They soon disappeared,
to add another failure to the long list of disappointments
in connection with accumulator traction.</p>

<p>The private electric automobile remains, however,
because it has been organised under conditions which
suit the peculiarities of the storage battery. Its survival,
in conjunction with the failure of a similar means of
transit for tramway, omnibus, and public cab services,
has pointed to another direction in which the electric
automobile should be a commercial possibility. That
is, in connection with the local distribution of goods
from large stores and other centres.</p>

<p>The United States have given a very distinct lead
in this matter. In New York, Chicago, Washington,
and other large cities the electric automobile for
private use is highly developed and there is also an
extensive service of electric vehicles ranging in size
from a small parcels van to a large lorry capable of
carrying loads up to several tons. No doubt the
local cost of other means of transport has something
to do with this American development, which has,
moreover, been strongly supported by the companies
which supply electricity to the public. But the fundamental
reason lies in the special character of the
service demanded.</p>

<p>The vans belonging to a large store all start from
a certain point and return to it after journeys of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
limited range. Owing to the period occupied in
loading up, and also to the pre-determined hours
of most of the deliveries, there is no difficulty about
affording the time required for re-charging the batteries,
or in arranging each journey so that the vehicle
returns before the batteries are exhausted. With a
standardised fleet of vehicles, it is possible to remove
the discharged batteries and replace them with charged
ones in a few minutes. The whole arrangement, in
fact, is like a private automobile garage, with the
advantage that the probable demand can be forecast
with a somewhat greater degree of certainty.</p>

<p>Steam and petrol-driven wagons run most economically
on long steady journeys at fairly high speeds,
and the electric automobile does not attempt to
compete with them on these lines. But it offers
competition within city limits for door-to-door
delivery; and its prospects are particularly good for
light parcel service, where the horse is still maintaining
its position against the petrol vehicle. The advantages
of the electric vehicle in neatness and noiselessness
will certainly secure its success if the cost can be
proved to be not appreciably greater than that of its
rivals.</p>

<p>Apart from the necessity of careful organisation,
the main essential of success in electric automobile
work is a supply of cheap electricity. Owners of
private electric launches have to pay anything from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
8<i>d.</i> to 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per unit for re-charging their batteries,
but these high prices are due to the intermittent
character of the demand and also (in some cases)
to the cost of providing machinery to supply current
at special pressures for particular launches. An
electric automobile garage, situated close to a public
generating station and offering a larger and more
regular demand, will of course obtain current much
cheaper. And it is possible that arrangements may
be made for supplying electricity to automobiles
at a much lower rate even than that customary for
general power demands. In the metropolitan borough
of Marylebone, for instance, an electric garage may
obtain current during the small hours of the night
at 1/2<i>d.</i> per unit, which is half the standard rate for
power purposes. This low price is offered because
there is otherwise practically no demand at all for
electricity during these hours. If, therefore, a garage
arranges&mdash;and the arrangement is quite feasible&mdash;to
charge its batteries overnight, the power bill may be
divided by two.</p>

<p>The electric automobile has been used to some
extent as a touring car, but although journeys up to
100 miles have been performed on a single charge,
the time occupied in re-charging, and the difficulty of
finding convenient charging stations, are fatal to any
development in this field.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br /><br />

<small>PETROL-ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND MAIN MARINE
PROPULSION BY ELECTRICITY</small></h2>


<p>Between the petrol-driven vehicle and the electric
automobile there is an interesting series of links
provided by 'petrol-electric' systems.</p>

<p>At one end of the chain, electricity plays an
important part in supplying power to drive the car.
At the other end, electrical apparatus is introduced
merely as a form of transmission gear between the
petrol engine and the driving axle. The reason for
attempting the petrol-electric combination will be
most readily understood by considering the latter
arrangement first.</p>

<p>The petrol engine is a high-speed engine, capable
of working most satisfactorily when it runs at a
uniform rate with a constant load. On the other
hand, the speed of the driving axle of a car varies
from a very much lower speed down to zero. It is
therefore necessary, when driving a vehicle with a
petrol engine, to arrange some forms of variable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>speed-reducing transmission gear between the engine
and the driving axle. The problem is further complicated
by the fact that the petrol engine is irreversible,
has practically no 'starting torque,' and has a very
slight overload capacity. It has to be started
running 'light' and then switched on to a low gear
which gives sufficient power to overcome the inertia
of the car. As the speed of the car rises, there have
to be successive changes of gear. These difficulties
are, of course, accentuated when dealing with the
heavy weight of an omnibus.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%" >
<img src="images/083.jpg" alt="Petrol-electric motor omnibus" style="width: 80%" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="pill">Fig. 9. Elevation and plan of a petrol-electric motor omnibus equipped by W. A. Stevens, Ltd.
Directly behind the front wheels is the petrol engine, driving a dynamo through a flexible
coupling. The dynamo supplies current to the motor directly behind it; and the motor
drives the rear wheels through a cardan shaft. The transmission of power between the
engine and the shaft is electrical at all speeds.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>


<p>Practically all the troubles with petrol motor
omnibuses have resided in the gear; and even the
most ardent enthusiast for the all-electric faith must
admit that the motor engineer has overcome these
troubles (in great part if not wholly) with remarkable
skill and ingenuity. But the complications of an
adjustable mechanical bridge between a high-speed
engine and a varying low-speed axle are so great
that an electrical bridge was proposed as a substitute.
By coupling the engine direct to a dynamo
and by using the current so generated to drive
variable-speed motors geared to the driving axle, the
electrical engineer hoped to get better working
results from the petrol motor than could be obtained
with any mechanical transmission gear.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous advantage, apart from the
quietness of running at all speeds, lies in the ease
and smoothness with which the petrol-electric motor
can start and gain speed. In this respect the combination
system is practically on the same level
as (or even superior to) the electric tramcar or the
electric automobile. There is an entire absence of
the jerks and jarring noises which usually accompany
the starting of a motor omnibus. The same facility
of control is of advantage in adjusting speed to suit
the other traffic on the road, and also in negotiating
hills.</p>

<p>In one class of petrol-electric vehicles the electric
transmission gear is continuously used. In another,
it is used at all speeds except the highest, when the
engine is coupled directly (by a magnetic clutch) to
a mechanical driving gear. In a third class the
arrangement is more complicated, as it involves the
use of storage batteries as an auxiliary to the power
provided directly by the petrol engine. The Fischer
type of petrol-electric vehicle uses electric transmission
solely and has a fairly large battery to supplement
the engine-produced current when steep hills are
being negotiated. At ordinary speeds on level roads
the surplus power produced by the engine goes to
charge the battery.</p>

<p>The 'Automixte' type is peculiar in using the
mechanical transmission gear all the time. The
dynamo coupled to the engine supplies current to a
small battery when surplus power is available; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
same dynamo may be driven as a motor by current
from the battery when such assistance is wanted at
starting or on steep hills. The electric part of the
equipment thus acts first as a generator and then as
a motor, the change taking place automatically.</p>

<p>These different petrol-electric devices are very
attractive from the engineering point of view, but at
the present time it is uncertain whether they will
realise the hopes of their inventors. The additional
weight of the electric equipment is against them;
and in some cases there appears to be a lower all-round
efficiency. So that the motor-omnibus world,
as a whole, continues to fix its faith upon the improved
forms of mechanical transmission.</p>

<p>The underlying idea of the petrol-electric system
has, however, been suggested for marine propulsion
with a somewhat better prospect of success.</p>

<p>There is a partial analogy between the conditions
of motor omnibus working and of ship propulsion with
turbines. The steam turbine is, like the petrol engine,
essentially a high-speed machine. The screw propeller,
on the other hand, works most efficiently at low
speeds. Therefore the marine engineer has to try
and find some common denominator between an
engine which runs most efficiently at high speeds
and a propeller which is at its best when revolving
comparatively slowly.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="pill">Fig. 10. Diagrammatic section of a steamship which has been 'converted' from the ordinary
method of propulsion to the 'Paragon' system of electric main marine propulsion. The reciprocating
engine has been replaced by a steam turbine, coupled direct to an electric generator which
supplies current to a motor attached to the propeller shaft. The tests carried out with this vessel
will indicate the advantages of the electric method of propulsion even with the usual long length of
shaft. The vessel has a gross tonnage of 1241, and its speed is 9 knots. The engines replaced
ran at 78 revolutions per minute and gave 500 brake horse power. The turbine now installed runs
at 2500 r.p.m., and develops 630 brake horse power. (Illustration reproduced by courtesy of
<i>The Electrician</i>.)</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>



<p>The gulf between the two has been narrowed by
the improved design of propellers. Some engineers
assert that continued improvements will bridge the
gulf completely. Others have sought the solution in
the same way as the motor engineer&mdash;by the use of
mechanical change-speed gears. The suggestion has
also been made to employ hydraulic gear as an
intermediary; and in some recent vessels reciprocating
engines with comparatively low-speed turbines
driven by exhaust steam have been adopted.</p>

<p>In the electric system the turbine is coupled direct
to an electric generator and may run continuously at
the highest economical speed. The propeller shaft
may be quite short and is driven by a slow speed
motor connected by cables to the generator. Various
arrangements for controlling the supply of current to
the motor (with appropriate design of generator and
motor) have been devised by Mr Durtnall, Mr Mavor,
and other workers in this field; but whatever the
details of these arrangements may be, they all give
a wide range of speed both ahead and astern. The
direct drive with the steam turbine has really only
one speed&mdash;full speed ahead; and as the turbine is
irreversible, 'astern' turbines have to be installed in
addition. These limitations and complications are
removed entirely when electrical transmission is
adopted.</p>

<p>Moreover, the electric system can be so arranged
that the control gear may be operated from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
bridge itself. The facility in manoeuvring is, in fact,
so marked that it would recommend electric marine
propulsion even if that system offered no advantages
on the score of economy in weight, space, and steam
consumption over the existing systems. The steam
turbine, it may be noted, has been adopted so far
only in high-speed vessels; and it is generally
recognised that its extension to vessels which run
at 12 or 16 knots depends upon its adaptation to
slow-speed propellers. Advocates of electric marine
propulsion claim that they hold the most efficient
solution of this problem.</p>

<p>It may also be pointed out that a considerable
section of marine engineers look forward to the use
of internal combustion engines (driven by oil or gas)
on board ship. For naval purposes especially it
would be a great advantage to do away with funnels
and so leave the decks more free for gun mountings.
As internal combustion engines are irreversible, the
electric system offers a means of escape from a
fundamental drawback to their use at sea. Here
again the perfection of manoeuvring power, especially
with twin screws (either of which may be controlled
from the bridge through a wide range of speed ahead
or astern), gives the electric system a strong claim for
consideration by the naval authorities.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary, except as a matter of
curiosity, to refer to the suggestions made, from time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
to time, of accumulator-driven ocean steamships.
Some wonderful pictures have been published of
large vessels with tons of ballast in the form of
storage batteries. They are likely to remain in this
ideal condition, for although the driving of a large
vessel by stored electricity is quite possible, it is also
about the most expensive method which has ever
been proposed.</p>

<p>Electric power from storage batteries has been
used as an auxiliary in the propulsion and manoeuvring
of submarines. In aerial navigation electricity has so
far been employed to a very limited extent. Small
airships have been designed to carry electric accumulators
connected with various motor-driven
propellers for raising, lowering, going ahead or
astern, and steering. The switches which control
the passage of the current to these propellers are
connected with a wireless telegraph receiver, so that
each operation may be started or stopped by a
particular ether wave or series of waves. Demonstrations
of such 'wireless-controlled' airships have
been given in theatres; their field of usefulness,
if any, is in connection with war on land or sea.
Whether they will have any better fate than other
devices for dropping bombs over the enemy's camps
or ships remains to be seen.</p>

<p>One inventor has, I believe, suggested a means
of direct electrical propulsion for aeroplanes, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
current being derived from a petrol-driven generator
and carried to motors attached to propellers so
arranged as to give certain advantages in stability
and manoeuvring. As yet, however, the probability
of electricity being applied to locomotion in the air
as well as on land and on sea is somewhat remote.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br /><br />

<small>THE PIONEER ELECTRIC RAILWAYS</small></h2>


<p>Electric tramways have reached a period of
middle age in which they are more concerned about
their internal economy than the prospect of enterprise
in new directions. Such development as they feel
capable of making under present legislative conditions
is only by proxy and tentatively, with the aid of the
trolley omnibus.</p>

<p>Electric railways, however, have still many worlds
to conquer. They are now in much the same position
as electric tramways held about the year 1896. That
is to say, they have already given practical proof of
their capabilities and enabled engineers to point out
the directions along which they are certain to develop.
In the railway world there is a growing conviction
that the adoption of electric traction on all suburban
and inter-urban railways must be simply a matter of
time. For main line traffic the possibilities of using
electricity are as yet only an article of faith among
electrical engineers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the earliest experiments in electric
traction were made in the railway form, the first
electric lines could hardly be regarded as railways
in the ordinary sense. They were really light railways,
in which the traffic conditions approximated to those
of tramways. The routes were short, the cars small,
and the traffic of modest dimensions. They contained
the germ of both the tramway and the railway; but,
in the case of the railway, many years of technical
development had to pass before the problem of
applying electricity to the handling of large masses
of traffic under standard railway conditions was
solved.</p>

<p>The fact that the first electric railway in the
United Kingdom was constructed at the Giant's
Causeway (in 1883) is significant. The Giant's
Causeway is one of the few places in our islands
where water power is available close to a district
with a demand for traffic facilities. In 1885 another
electric railway deriving its energy from water-driven
turbines was built between Bessbrook and Newry.
At that period it was considered that waterfalls
provided the only really feasible source of cheap
electricity on a large scale. Even yet the impression
survives that electric power stations using steam
cannot produce current so cheaply as those which
'harness' waterfalls. Many people, in fact, are
inclined to attribute the comparative backwardness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of electrical development in Great Britain, not to
legislative conditions, but to the lack of large
waterfalls.</p>

<p>There might have been more active progress in
the pioneering days if the presence of water power
at convenient points had encouraged electrical
engineers to repeat the experiments at Portrush
and Bessbrook. But at an early stage in electrical
history it became clear to engineers that coal was
just as feasible a source of cheap power as water.
The idea that a waterfall provides power 'for nothing'
is one of those superficial conceptions which make
the hardiest of fallacies. To 'harness' a waterfall
requires a heavy expenditure of capital on conduits,
pipe-lines, dams, and other works. The interest
upon that capital is a heavy item, apart from the
cost of maintenance and repairs. Waterfalls are
situated in mountainous country, generally remote
from the centres of industry; the water-power
station, therefore, has to face the cost of transmission
mains and the loss of energy involved in conveying
the power to the place where it is wanted. Further,
waterfalls and the adjacent ground belong either to
individuals or to the State; and payment is generally
exacted for the right to use them.</p>

<p>All these items have to be covered in the price
charged for current to the public or to railway
undertakings. Nature may provide the 'head' of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
water 'free,' but man has to spend money in
utilising it, just as he has to do in mining and in
obtaining heat from the coal which is also provided
'free.' Anything which is obtained 'for nothing' is
generally worth nothing.</p>

<p>The full economies of generating electricity by
steam power are not, however, realised until business
is done on a large scale. As the first essential
of a successful electric railway is a plentiful supply
of cheap power, development from the experimental
stage of Portrush had to wait until engineers
mastered the art of producing electricity from large
generators. They gained the necessary experience
with electric tramways and in electric lighting. We
have seen how, as regards tramways, legislation
delayed and hampered progress. A similar cause
was at work in connection with electric lighting.
In 1882 an Act was passed regulating electric
lighting on lines modelled upon the principles of the
Tramways Act, 1870. Capitalists declined to work
under this Act; and it was not until after 1888,
when the Act was amended, that any money could be
found in Great Britain for electric lighting schemes.
This delay was a serious handicap not only to electric
lighting but to the business of British electrical
manufacturing, as there was, comparatively speaking,
no demand for electrical plant for over six years.
Meanwhile, matters had been advancing on normal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
lines in other countries; and when the demand came
at last, the manufacturers on the Continent and
in America were the only ones organised and ready
to meet it.</p>

<p>These points must be touched upon in order to
understand why so long a period elapsed between
the pioneer electric railways and the real electric
railway movement as we know it to-day. They also
serve to explain the prominent part which American
and German firms took in electrical developments
here. Engineering and legislative conditions combined
to retard electric railway enterprise so that it
did not begin to take firm root in Great Britain until
about 1890, and did not attain to any conspicuous
growth until the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Until after 1890 the only electric railways in
Great Britain taking power from steam dynamos
were those at Brighton Beach, Ryde Pier (Isle of
Wight) and Southend Pier, opened in 1883, 1886 and
1890 respectively. These were all, of course, of short
length. The Brighton Beach railway, designed and
constructed by Mr Magnus Volk, was a unique piece
of work. The rails were laid on heavy concrete
blocks below high-water mark; and the cars were
platforms raised on a light iron structure. Power
was conveyed to the cars from wires hung on posts
like the standards of a tramway on the trolley system.
The unusual sensation of travelling over the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
was enjoyed by hundreds of people until the difficulty
of maintaining the track (owing to the erosive action
of the waves) led to the railway being abandoned and
another line of more ordinary character being laid on
the level of the undercliff roadway.</p>

<p>The first indication of the genuine electric railway
movement was given in 1893, when the Liverpool
Overhead Railway was opened. This line was constructed
to afford communication along the line of
docks fringing the Mersey. The track was carried on
a continuous bridge in order to avoid obstruction
between the docks and the streets behind; and being
overhead, there were serious disadvantages attached
to the use of steam locomotives. Electric locomotives
were therefore employed.</p>

<p>In this case, it should be noted, electricity was
not adopted because it was more economical or
efficient than steam. The reason lay with the
peculiar situation of the railway. A similar reason
decided the promoters of the City and South London
Railway to try electric locomotives on their line.
This railway, which was opened in 1890, was the first
deep level or 'tube' railway in the world. Moreover,
it was constructed and equipped throughout by
British engineers, and at a time when the art of
tunnelling was much less advanced than it is now.
In the later and more imposing development of
tube railways in London, the foresight and enterprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
displayed by the pioneers of the City and South
London Railway are apt to be overlooked. It was,
however, the success of the original line from the
Monument to Clapham which made it possible to
raise capital for the Central London Railway (opened
in 1900) and for the extensive tube railway system
organised by the Underground Electric Railways
Company of London.</p>

<p>On a deep-level railway, steam is, of course, out
of the question. Even on the old 'Underground,'
built close to the surface and furnished with frequent
openings at the stations, and by means of ventilating
shafts, the atmospheric conditions were abominable.
The sulphurous fumes were indeed recommended
for asthma and other complaints, but on a tube
railway they would have been sufficient to cure every
human ailment. Therefore the choice lay between
electric traction and haulage by cables, compressed
air, or some other innocuous system. Within these
limits electricity was chosen on its merits.</p>

<p>The first railway in Great Britain to undertake
conversion was one in which both the physical and
economic troubles were exceptionally serious. The
Mersey Railway is little more than a tunnel under
the river, and it is distinguished by heavy gradients
and by the continuous necessity of pumping out the
water which drains into it. With steam traction the
difficulty of ventilating the tunnel was an added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
trouble. Owing to these various causes the working
expenses were abnormally heavy, and led ultimately
to a receivership. Electric traction was adopted as
the only possible cure. The pumping and ventilation
arrangements were both reorganised for electric
power; and the trains were equipped with electric
traction on the 'multiple-unit' system, an arrangement&mdash;to
be described in the next chapter&mdash;which
is well suited to the economical handling of steep
gradients. The practical result was a great increase
in traffic, with a marked decrease in the proportion
of expenses to receipts.</p>

<p>No other British railways, happily, were in so
desperate a condition as the Mersey line, but all of
them were, at the end of last century, feeling the
effect of certain disquieting tendencies. These tendencies
were most marked in connection with suburban
and short-distance inter-urban traffic, which is quite
distinct in character from the main-line traffic. We
talk glibly enough of railway traffic as if it were a
unity, but it is clear that very different considerations
govern the traffic on a main line between, say, London
and Glasgow, and those which control the traffic on
London suburban routes or on a railway connecting
the adjacent towns of the Potteries. Some railways
have to deal with all three classes at the same time
and occasionally on the same lines of rails. Electric
traction has, so far, made itself felt only where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
suburban or similar inter-urban traffic has been
separable from the main line traffic.</p>

<p>The growth which took place in suburban traffic
before and after the end of the century ought to have
brought increased prosperity to the railway companies,
but it did not always do so. Competition between
the various companies led to a reduction in fares;
Parliament, by establishing workmen's fares, forced
the companies to carry an ever-increasing number
of passengers at a loss, or at least without profit;
wages tended to increase and hours of working to
decrease&mdash;both affecting the cost of operation; rates
and taxes became heavier and heavier with the
growth of municipal expenditure; and a higher
standard of comfort and efficiency was demanded by
the public. In some instances the situation was
aggravated by the competition of electric tramways
along routes parallel to the railways. This competition
was limited to point-to-point traffic, its maximum
range being about three miles; but it was a grievance
against which the railway companies protested very
loudly, especially when the tramways were owned by
local authorities to which the railways paid large sums
in rates.</p>

<p>The general effect of all these factors was to
reduce the margin of profit on which the railways
were working. We have seen, in the case of tramways,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>how easy it is for a slight change in a frequently-recurring
expense to have a serious effect in the
aggregate. Railways are in much the same position;
and the various influences at work upon the suburban
traffic brought them face to face with the importance,
if not the necessity, of finding some means of dealing
with larger volumes of traffic on a basis more economical
than that provided by steam locomotives.</p>

<p>This means they found in electric traction; but it
may be noted that even railway engineers took some
time to realise exactly what electric traction offered
them. They were looking for something to reduce
their annual expenses; and when they made calculations
about electric traction they found that, when
the expense of providing the electrical equipment
was taken into account, the total cost of hauling the
trains electrically on the existing schedule might be
greater instead of less than the cost of steam haulage.
They were therefore inclined to look upon the
economic benefits of electric traction as an illusion.</p>

<p>In course of time, however, it came to be recognised
that the function of electricity is not to act like a
blue pencil on the debit side of the revenue account.
Its essential purpose is to increase the volume of
traffic. From the public point of view this is very
much more valuable. Passengers are not directly
concerned with means of reducing working expenses,
but they are closely interested in the improvement
of the frequency and speed of the service. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
adoption of electricity on suburban lines has really
been dictated by the demand for increased facilities.
At the 'rush' hours of the morning and evening,
when the great tide of workers flows and ebbs, the
capacity of the steam lines was taxed to the utmost.
And with the growth of population the difficulty of
running sufficiently frequent trains became almost
insuperable.</p>

<p>Apart from these particular necessities, the general
features of railway economics point to the supreme
advantage of increasing the volume of traffic in every
possible way. In a railway, as in a tramway, the
preponderating item is the cost of construction and
maintenance; and unless a certain minimum of traffic
is carried, the most economical working in the world
will not secure a profit. The standing charges fall
upon the idle hours as well as upon the busy; for
every minute that a line of rails stands empty there
is a loss of money. Railway progress depends upon
reducing the proportion of idle hours; and that can
only be done where there is scope for the growth of
traffic, and where there is means&mdash;such as electric
traction&mdash;of dealing with that growth on an economical
basis.</p>

<p>In the succeeding chapter it is explained how
electric traction enables a more frequent service
to be run with advantage even on systems which were
worked to the maximum limit possible under steam
conditions. But in the meantime it will be interesting
to trace the effect itself on a railway which soon
followed the Mersey Railway in making the change
from steam to electricity&mdash;the Metropolitan District
Railway.</p>

<p>Throughout the steam age the finance of the
District Railway Company was as unattractive as the
physical conditions of the railway itself. No dividend
was ever paid on the ordinary shares; and even with
the growth of London there was little prospect of
any dividend ever being paid. When&mdash;about ten
years ago&mdash;the late Mr C. T. Yerkes came over from
America and obtained a controlling interest in the
District Railway Company with a view to converting it
to electric traction, he was regarded as a philanthropic
enthusiast. Many of the shareholders themselves
were reluctant to give their assent to the change;
they preferred to bear the ills they knew than fly to
others which might be introduced by an American
financier.</p>

<p>But Mr Yerkes and those who worked with him
had something more in view than the improvement
of traffic on the District Railway. They acquired
control of several tube railway schemes and obtained
powers for new lines, so as to organise a comprehensive
system of underground electric transport in London.
They had sufficient faith in the traffic possibilities of
London to find the enormous capital required to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
construct these tube railways and also to convert the
whole District Railway to electric traction. The
constructional work occupied several years; and after
the lines were opened one by one, arrangements had
to be developed for through-bookings among the
various lines and between them all and the existing
underground railways like the Central London Railway,
the Metropolitan Railway (closely linked with
the Metropolitan District) and the City and South
London Railway. A systematic attempt was also
made to develop the travelling habit in London by
persistent advertising of the railway services and by
increasing the frequency and rapidity of the trains.
From these points of view the organisation of the
network of lines comprehensively known by the title
of 'Underground' is certainly unsurpassed.</p>

<p>The difficulties which had to be overcome in this
great work were enormous, but there has been no
break in the thread of progress. The 'tubes' are
paying dividends which, though modest, are an encouragement
to further developments. The finance
of the District Railway has lost its element of chronic
despair. Considered as a whole, the results prove
that where there is the potentiality of large traffic,
electricity is the instrument which must be applied.
During the steam days, the most crowded part of
the District Railway (the 'Inner Circle') carried a
maximum of 16 trains per hour. With electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
traction that figure has been raised to 40 trains per
hour. And the remarkable thing is that with each
increase in the service the traffic grows. Many people
welcomed the electrification of the District as a
measure of relief from the overcrowding on the
steam trains during the busy hours. But with a
service of trains more than doubled in frequency and
also increased in capacity per train, overcrowding
continues and the 'straphanger' has become an established
institution.</p>

<p>It may be accepted as substantially proved that,
on suburban and inter-urban railways in populous
districts, electric traction is a means of increasing
traffic and diminishing the proportion of working
costs. Moreover, these results have been achieved
in conjunction with substantial reductions in fares
and with marked improvements in the comfort of
travelling.</p>

<p>The engineering aspect of these changes has now
to be considered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br /><br />

<small>ELECTRIC RAILWAYS FROM THE ENGINEERING
POINT OF VIEW</small></h2>


<p>When electric railways were first considered, the
natural tendency of engineers was to follow the
existing model and merely substitute electric locomotives
for steam locomotives. In point of fact,
however, the engineering method now adopted is
an evolution from the tramway model, not from that
of the typical railway.</p>

<p>A certain advantage was, of course, to be gained
by replacing steam locomotives by electric ones.
The greater 'starting torque' of the electric locomotive
enables it to get a train up to full speed more quickly;
and the capacity of the electric motor for taking heavy
overloads assists the electric train in surmounting
heavy gradients. Some advantage was also gained
by producing all the power at a central source,
instead of having a large number of steam locomotives,
which are really power stations on wheels. But the
electric locomotive had still to be made heavy enough
to get sufficient grip of the rails; it had to haul its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
own dead weight; and it had to be made powerful
enough to tackle a full-sized train on the steepest
gradient with its complement of passengers, although
the general demand upon it might be considerably
less than that maximum.</p>

<p>The electric locomotive, in short, was an advance
upon the steam locomotive, but it did not get past
the essential drawbacks of the locomotive system.
A locomotive is most economical when hauling full
trains for long distances at a uniform speed; it is
essentially a long-distance machine. The first demand
for electrification came, however, from suburban
railways, where the stations are close together and
where, therefore, the speed is constantly varying
from zero up to a maximum and back to zero again.
The traffic also fluctuates between extreme limits;
and there is obvious waste in having to run heavy
locomotives and trains backwards and forwards during
the slack hours. There was therefore a demand for
some method of propulsion which would enable the
length of trains and the consumption of power to be
adjusted more closely to the variations in the traffic.</p>

<p>A step in the right direction was taken when the
locomotive equipment was placed on a car, thus
utilising the weight of the passengers to increase the
adhesion on the rails. But the full advantages of
electric traction were not realised until what is
known as the 'multiple-unit' system was adopted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>The idea underlying this system is quite simple.
If, instead of concentrating the motive power on a
single locomotive or driving unit, we distribute it
among the cars forming a train, we get the multiple-unit
system. An electric tramcar and a trailer attached
to another tramcar and trailer, with a third tramcar
behind, would form a model for a multiple-unit train.
By connecting the electrical equipments on the three
tramcars&mdash;front, middle, and rear&mdash;it would be possible
to control the train from either end or from the
middle.</p>

<p>This is the principle upon which all the electric
railways in Great Britain are now worked, with the
exception of the City and South London Railway,
where locomotives are still used and where the trains
are comparatively short and light.</p>

<p>It will be seen that each multiple-unit train is
readily divisible. A single motor car may be run, or a
car with one or two trailers, or a long train made up
of as many motor cars and trailers as the platforms
will accommodate. And whether the trains are long
or short, the power absorbed is in proportion to the
length of the train and the load of passengers. By
this simple means power is economised, and the
railway engineer is able to reduce the proportion of
idle rolling stock.</p>

<p>The adjustment of the length of trains to the
fluctuations of the service is made easier by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
absence, in the multiple-unit system, of the necessity
of shunting at the termini. As a multiple-unit train
can be controlled from either end, a more frequent
as well as a more flexible service can be run. With
steam traction the number of trains which may enter
or leave a terminus is limited by the time occupied
in shunting and by the necessity of leaving lines of
rails free for that operation. With an electric train
on the multiple-unit system, no more time is lost
than the few seconds necessary for the driver to
walk from the front of the train to the rear, which
then becomes the 'front.' No lines have to be kept
open for shunting locomotives, so that the available
accommodation for trains is considerably increased.
Some of the London railway companies have spent
enormous sums in enlarging their terminal accommodation
and have found that it is still inadequate
to the demands of the 'rush' traffic. Electric
traction therefore offers them an improvement of
enormous value without the expenditure of a penny
on station alterations.</p>

<p>The crowning advantage of electric traction lies,
however, in the more rapid acceleration which it
affords. We have already seen how important this
item is on tramways. It is still more important on
suburban railways, where a high average speed, in
spite of frequent stops, is a vital matter.</p>

<p>On the District Railway the rate of acceleration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
in the old steam days was about 6 inches per second
per second. It was, in fact, so low that the trains
could not reach a fair speed before the brakes had
to be applied to bring the train to a stop at the next
station. With electric traction the rate of acceleration
has risen to about 18 inches per second per second. On
the Liverpool Overhead Railway a rate of 36 inches
per second per second was reached in certain tests.
Heavy starting currents are, of course, necessary to
bring a train from rest to full speed at such a rapid
rate, but it is quite possible for the electrical engineer,
without being unduly extravagant in current, to
accelerate a train more quickly than the passengers
would find comfortable.</p>

<p>The practical result of rapid acceleration (combined
with rapid braking) is not only to give a higher
average speed but also to enable a more frequent
service to be run. Owing to the block system on
railways it is impossible for trains to follow each
other closely in the manner of tramcars; and it is
therefore of cardinal importance that no train should
occupy a block for one second more than is necessary.
Rapid acceleration becomes all the more important
in this respect because of the difficulty of setting
down and picking up passengers quickly. This
difficulty is overcome in part by using saloon
carriages with middle and end doors, in place of
compartment carriages. At first the District Railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
tried to help matters by operating these doors pneumatically,
but the mechanism became unpopular after
a number of late-comers had been pinched by closing
doors. The management has reverted to hand operation;
and it has probably achieved more by educating
the public to move quickly than it would have gained
with its too-perfect mechanical system.</p>

<p>London travellers have become so accustomed to
entering and leaving trains quickly that it is possible
for an observer to distinguish strangers by their
slower movements on an underground railway. Thus
the passenger, as well as the service, has been 'speeded-up.'
The more frequent service of trains with a higher
average speed would not have been possible, however,
without an improvement upon the old methods of
signalling. There is no need to dwell upon the
weakness of the human element in railway signalling;
and it will be clear even to the layman that the
strain of handling traffic with a headway of one
minute and a half, or less, would be more than men
could stand. Automatic signalling had therefore to
be adopted to obviate the risk of disaster.</p>

<p>Each train, as it leaves a block or section, 'clears'
the signals for that block; and when any train attempts
to enter a block against signals, the current is automatically
switched off and the brakes applied. The
system is so perfect that, in spite of the enormous
traffic worked under it, there has been no failure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
no accident. It is, of course, costly to install; and its
cost can be justified (financially) only when the traffic
is very heavy&mdash;that is to say, when the conditions
make it almost a necessity.</p>

<p>The supply of electric power to electric railways
is organised on practically the same lines as in the
case of tramways. That is to say, current is generated
at a central station, transmitted at high pressure to
various sub-stations, and supplied from there at
working pressure through 'feeders' to each section of
the system. In the case of the 'Underground' system,
most of the power is taken from a single huge
electric station at Chelsea. Current from that station
drives trains as far west as Wimbledon, Hounslow,
and Ealing, as far north as Highgate and Golder's
Green, and as far east as Barking.</p>

<p>This is a magnificent example of the concentration
which gives economy. If each of the underground
railways forming the system had erected its own
generating station, the total initial outlay, on land,
buildings, and machinery, would have been greater,
and the cost of current would have been higher, owing
to the smaller output and the more irregular demand
which a single railway affords. The ideal electric
power station is one which is constructed with the
largest generating units and produces current at its
maximum capacity throughout the twenty-four hours
of each day. The Chelsea power station is nearer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
ideal than a smaller one supplying a short railway
could be. And a station of the latter class is, it may
be noted, nearer the ideal than the arrangements
on a steam railway, where the sources of power are
scattered in hundreds of locomotives.</p>

<p>The concentration of power is therefore one of
the many factors which have enabled electric railways
to give a vastly improved service at lower fares.</p>

<p>With two exceptions&mdash;to be considered in the
next chapter&mdash;the electric railways of Great Britain
are constructed on the 'third-rail' system. They are
thus a reversion to&mdash;or, rather, a survival of&mdash;the
original type adopted by Siemens in 1879. The
'third-rail' is carried on insulators a few inches
outside the track rail; and the motor cars are
provided with a 'brush' or 'shoe' which slides along
it and collects the current. In the centre of the
track there is generally a second insulated rail to
carry the return current, as it is more convenient,
under railway conditions, to have a conductor independent
of the track rails than to follow the
tramway plan of using the rails 'bonded' together.
In stations and at crossings the third or 'live' rail
is protected by a wooden board in order to reduce
the risk of shock to anyone falling on the line or
walking upon it. The board is placed high enough
over the rail to allow the shoe to pass freely.</p>

<p>As regards the motor equipment on the cars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
tramway models have been followed very closely.
The 'series-parallel' system of control is again adopted
in order to get the high starting torque which
gives rapid acceleration with moderate current consumption.
The course of the current is again from
the live rail, through the controller, through the
motors, and thence to the return rail. The controller
itself is more or less on the tramway principle;
and the main modification in it is the arrangement
which enables all the motors on a multiple-unit
train to be operated by a single controller. This is
done by connecting the controllers electrically and
using electric power so that they all work in unison.
Some companies use, for this purpose, compressed air
controlled by electricity instead of electric power
alone, but in both cases the principle is essentially
the same.</p>

<p>Considered as a whole, the difference between a
tramway and an electric railway on the third-rail
system is a difference in degree, not in kind. The
traffic is greater and the speeds higher, but both
serve the purposes of comparatively short-distance
transit. Indeed, within certain limits they compete
with each other.</p>

<p>There remains to be considered another type of
British electric railway which points the way to the
extension of the new mode of traction to main line
railways.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br /><br />

<small>ELECTRIC TRACTION ON MAIN LINE RAILWAYS</small></h2>


<p>On tramways, automobiles, and 'third-rail' lines,
the electric current used belongs to the type described
as 'continuous' or 'direct,' because the flow is always
in the same direction. The other type of current is
known as 'alternating,' as it flows backwards and
forwards many times per second. There are several
kinds of alternating current&mdash;single-phase, two-phase,
three-phase, and polyphase&mdash;each produced from
generators designed in a particular way.</p>

<p>It is not possible to give any adequate account
of these different kinds of alternating current without
going rather deeply into the theory of electricity.
The ultimate practical point is that in transmitting
alternating currents the circuits increase in number
with the phases. Thus, three-phase current requires
three wires, two-phase current three or four wires,
and single-phase current a single circuit like that of
continuous current<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p class="pill">Fig. 12. Photograph of a train on the electrified section of the London, Brighton and South
Coast Railway. The overhead wire is suspended from cables stretched between insulators,
and current is conveyed from it to the trains through a 'bow' which slides along its lower
side. The photograph is taken from the rear part of the train. The front and rear cars are
both equipped with electric motors.</p>
</div>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>


<p>Where current has to be conveyed economically
over long distances, it is generally done in the form
of alternating current at high pressure. For instance,
the transmission from a tramway power station to
the sub-stations is almost uniformly by three-phase
current at, say, 5000 volts. When it reaches the sub-station,
it is 'transformed' down to the working
pressure of 500 volts and 'converted' from alternating
to continuous current by means of rotary machinery.
The transforming is done by a stationary piece of
apparatus similar in principle to the familiar induction
coil. An induction coil takes current at a few volts
from a battery into its primary circuit and transforms
it, by induction in the secondary circuit, into current
of high enough voltage to give a long spark. A
transformer can be designed to 'step-up' or 'step-down'
the pressure according to the requirements of
the case.</p>

<p>So much explanation is necessary to give some
account of the alternating current railways on the
Continent and thence of the single-phase system on
the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway.
The Morecambe and Heysham section of the Midland
Railway is also equipped on the single-phase system.</p>

<p>Most of the earliest electric railways on the
Continent derived their power from waterfalls and
had to transmit it for a considerable distance.
Three-phase current at high pressure being adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
for this purpose, the Continental engineers set to
work to find some means of utilising the high-pressure
three-phase current directly. They did this by carrying
the three wires on poles alongside the railway
track, and using three 'bow' collectors (in place of
trolley wheels) to convey the current to transformers
on the motor cars or locomotives. In these transformers
the current was brought down to working
pressure and then led to motors designed for three-phase
current.</p>

<p>An immense amount of technical ingenuity was
exercised in developing this system; and when the
Metropolitan Railway decided to follow the District
in electrifying its lines, a three-phase system was
proposed. As the Metropolitan and Metropolitan
District companies share the working of the Inner
Circle, it was necessary that both should adopt the
same system. The result was that the question
between three-phase and continuous current working
had to go to arbitration. After a long discussion of
masses of technical evidence, Mr Lyttelton, the arbitrator,
decided that the direct current system was
better suited to the conditions of traffic on an underground
railway in London.</p>

<p>The wisdom of that decision will not be questioned
now. Three-phase motors do not give the rapid
acceleration which is so urgently required on suburban
lines; there are complications in speed control;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
and the necessity of having three overhead conductors
is also a serious drawback. For comparatively long-distance
traffic with few stops, however, the three-phase
system is quite suitable. That is to say, it is a
possible solution of the main line problem.</p>

<p>The great simplicity and flexibility of the power
supply arrangements in the case of alternating current
traction encouraged engineers to find something better
adapted to ordinary railway conditions than the
three-phase motor. Their problem was to find an
arrangement which required one overhead conductor
instead of three, and also provided a motor with the
high starting torque and easy speed control of the
continuous-current motor. After much theoretical
and experimental work, they found it in the single-phase
system, using a motor which is similar in many
respects to the continuous-current motor but capable
of being operated by alternating current.</p>

<p>On the advice of Mr Philip Dawson, the London,
Brighton and South Coast Railway Company decided
to experiment with this system on the double line
connecting London Bridge and Victoria stations,
about 9 miles long. Power is supplied to each track
by a single overhead conductor carrying current at
6000 volts. Transformers are placed on the trains to
bring the pressure down to 300 volts; the current is
then led through controllers to single-phase motors
in much the usual way. The reason for using so high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
a pressure on the overhead line is not only economy
in transmission. If lower pressures were used, the
heavy currents required for train propulsion would
require a thicker conductor and correspondingly
heavier supports. At 6000 volts it is possible for
two double sliding bows to collect sufficient current
for a heavy train from a wire which is comparable
in thickness to the ordinary trolley wire of a tramway.</p>

<p>The power distribution arrangements, it will be
noticed, are very much simpler than with continuous
current on the third-rail system. There are no sub-stations
with rotary machinery. Power is supplied
direct from the generating station to the overhead line
and is transformed down by stationary plant on the
train itself. Single-phase traction represents, in fact,
power transmission for railway purposes reduced to
its simplest elements.</p>

<p>The overhead construction differs, however, in
some important points from the tramway standard.
The supports, which are in both bridge and bracket
form, are stronger; the insulators are, owing to the
much higher pressure employed, more massive; and
a different means of suspension has been adopted.
Each conductor is hung by links from two steel
cables stretched chain-wise between the supports.
This method of 'catenary suspension' enables the
bow to slide along the wire without the jolts which
are noticeable with a tramway trolley. Such smooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
running keeps the bow continuously at an even
pressure on the wire&mdash;an advantage which is of great
importance at high speeds. The trains are arranged
on the multiple-unit system.</p>

<p>The full financial results obtained on this railway
have not so far been made public; but it is sufficient
for our purpose to note that the Company, after more
than a year's full trial, extended the system to the
Crystal Palace and to Croydon. Further extensions
are, it is understood, contemplated over the suburban
lines to Sutton and elsewhere; and in course of time
the conversion of the main line to Brighton will be
undertaken.</p>

<p>Here we touch upon the most interesting aspect
of this demonstration of electric traction on the
single-phase system. The system was adopted in
the first instance because the third-rail system would
lead to complications and dangers which could not
be permitted at crowded railway termini shared by
all kinds of traffic, suburban and main line. But
the advisers of the Company had also in view the
possibility of development beyond the range of suburban
traffic. They therefore sought a system
which, while comparable to the third-rail continuous
current in the handling of suburban business, would
be adaptable to main line conditions, where infrequent
stops and long runs at high speeds are the rule.</p>

<p>The adoption of electric traction on such a route
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>as the Brighton main line would be a benefit in
several ways. It would lead to a faster express
service, as the high overload capacity of the electric
motor enables it to take small account of gradients.
It would also lead to a more frequent service, as the
electric system is free from the conditions which force
a steam railway to try to concentrate traffic on a
limited number of long trains. Further, it would, by
reducing the time lost in stopping and starting, bring
the average speed of stopping trains much closer to
that of express trains. All these improvements&mdash;assisted,
probably, by lower fares&mdash;should lead to a
great increase in the volume of traffic, thus reproducing
the characteristic results of electric traction
on suburban lines.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br /><br />

<small>CURIOSITIES OF ELECTRIC TRACTION</small></h2>


<p>Like many other industries, electric traction has
had its history brightened and made picturesque by
curiosities of invention. Locomotion has, in fact,
been a favourite field for the freak inventor; and
some of his efforts with electric cars have been as
weird and as fatuous as the most remarkable of
perpetual motion devices.</p>

<p>One of these electrical monstrosities was, indeed,
a kind of perpetual motion arrangement. It was
invented about the year 1890 and consisted of a car
equipped with accumulators which supplied power to
a motor which drove a hydraulic pump, which in
turn worked a dynamo supplying current to motors
driving the axles of the car, and also to the accumulator
for re-charging purposes. The inventor was so
sure that he had got the better of the law of the
conservation of energy that he provided his car with
pointed ends, fitted with revolving fans to break down
the air-pressure, in order that a speed of 125 miles
per hour might be achieved. His name was Amen;
and it provides a fitting comment upon his scheme.</p>

<p>Several electric flying-machine ideas found their
way on to the patent records. In 1893 a Frenchman
registered a design for an air-ship with a cigar-shaped
body and electrically-driven propellers. There was,
however, more originality in an American idea that
the progress of trains on the overhead railway might
be assisted by the action of balloons in taking the
weight of the cars off the rails. Curiously enough,
other original inventors tried to get the opposite
effect, by devising magnetic arrangements to increase
the adhesion of the wheels to the rails.</p>

<p>More plausible forms of super-ingenuity have
been exercised in connection with established modes
of electric traction.</p>

<p>For the conduit system one inventor suggested a
kind of reversion to the 'continuous valve' of the
old atmospheric railway. The slot of the conduit
was closed by a continuous series of springs which
would be opened in succession by the plough as it
passed along. This arrangement was actually tried on
an experimental track in London. Another inventor
proposed a novel plan for keeping the conductor in a
conduit free from damp. The conductor was to be
made hollow, so that hot air could be pumped through
it to dry off any accumulated moisture.</p>

<p>The most entertaining freak in connection with
the trolley system was a device to enable two lines
of car to use a single trolley wire. Cars going in one
direction were to carry a double-ended inclined plane
which would lift the trolley wheels of passing cars off
the wire and let them slip back again. The only
drawback to this arrangement was that it would not
work.</p>

<p>Another inventor who was apparently impressed
with the noise of trolley wheels on the wires designed
a trolley head fitted with a pneumatic tyre. If he
could have persuaded indiarubber to be anything but
one of the best of insulators, he would have been
completely successful.</p>

<p>One of the best known of electrical freaks&mdash;the
Heilmann locomotive (<a href="#Page_127">Fig. 14</a>)&mdash;is a very good example
of the way in which an invention may be tried with
enthusiasm, rejected with contumely, and revived at a
much later date in an improved and more promising
form. The Heilmann locomotive was practically a
generating station on wheels. It carried a boiler and
engines, which drove a dynamo, the current from which
was led through controllers to motors coupled to the
wheel axles. It was an enormous affair, over 18
metres long and running on sixteen wheels; extensive
trials were made with it on the Western Railway of
France in the early nineties. Some advantage was
gained in smoothness of running, ease and uniformity
of control, and improved acceleration; but its great
weight, cost, and complexity were against it. In spite
of the cordial support given to it by railway engineers,
it was soon relegated to the scrap-heap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>



<p>The Heilmann locomotive, it will be noticed, is
similar in principle to the petrol-electric systems of
propulsion now in use for road traction. But it is
probable that the idea would never have been heard
of again in connection with railway work had it not
been for the appearance of the steam turbine. It
was natural that the locomotive engineer should
consider how the turbine could be applied to his
purposes; and the first step in this inquiry made it
plain that some electric method of control was
necessary between the high-speed turbine and the
driving axle.</p>

<p>Consequently, when the engineers of the North
British Locomotive Company set to work in 1909 to
design an 'electric turbo-locomotive,' they produced
something not at all unlike the Heilmann locomotive.
The equipment consists of a steam turbine, with
elaborate condensing plant, a generator, and a group
of driving motors (<a href="#Page_129">Fig. 15</a>). The turbine runs at 3000
revolutions per minute and drives a continuous-current
dynamo, the current from which passes through
controllers to four motors which can be run in series,
or two in series and two in parallel, or all in parallel,
according to the draw-bar pull required. Trials with
this locomotive were begun early in 1910, but it is
yet too early to say whether it will be more fortunate
than the Heilmann locomotive, and whether it is likely
to delay the advance of the electric locomotive proper,
fed with power by overhead wires from a central
power station.</p>

<p>The possibilities of high speed on a mono-railway,
and especially an electric mono-railway, have acted
like a will-o'-the-wisp to the imaginations of many
engineers. Of the various systems suggested, only
one&mdash;the gyroscopic mono-railway invented by Mr
Brennan&mdash;seems likely to survive; and even in that
case victory under practical conditions is not yet
certain.</p>

<p>At Ballybunnion there is a steam mono-railway
which has been at work since 1888. It has had, so
far as I am aware, no imitators; but its engineer,
Mr Behr, retained so much faith in the principle
that he decided to apply it to the problem of high-speed
electric traction. During the 1900 session he
promoted a Bill for the construction of a mono-railway
between Liverpool and Manchester. There was
tremendous opposition from the existing railway
companies, which brought experts to prove that
Mr Behr was a vain dreamer; but the Bill succeeded.
The promoters, however, found it much harder work
to raise capital for the project. They needed close
upon £3,000,000, but the public response to the first
invitation was so small that the scheme was abandoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>The line, as projected, was nearly 35 miles long;
and a speed of 100 miles per hour was intended,
reducing the time of the Liverpool-Manchester
journey to twenty minutes. At each end of the
line (which was a double one) a steep gradient
was arranged to facilitate starting and stopping&mdash;an
arrangement, by the way, which is adopted to a
certain extent on London tubes. The track itself
was shaped like an inverted <b>V</b>, and practically the
whole of the weight of the cars was borne upon a
rail at the top. The wheels, therefore, were right in
the centre of the car, which balanced itself on the
trestle with its centre of gravity below the rail.
Each side of the trestle carried two guide-rails which
bore against free-running horizontal wheels on the
car to prevent any undue lateral movement. Each
car was designed to carry four motors with a total
normal capacity of 160 horse power and an overload
capacity up to 320 horse power. The rails for carrying
the current were placed on the track in very
much the same position as the ordinary rails occupy
on a normal railway.</p>

<p>In another form of mono-railway&mdash;the Kearney
high-speed railway&mdash;the wheels are placed below the
car and run on a single rail laid direct on sleepers.
The cars are held upright by flanged wheels on the
top, running on a rail fixed to the roof of tunnels or
to standards not unlike those of an overhead trolley.
This railway has been exhibited in the form of a
model.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>



<p>Mr Brennan's gyroscopic mono-railway was first
shown, in a small size, at a conversazione of the
Royal Society in 1907. Full-sized cars were constructed
later, and one was seen at work during the
Japan-British Exhibition of 1910. The distinguishing
feature of the vehicle is the use of two gyroscopes
(electrically driven), one horizontal and the other
vertical, to maintain the car upright on a single rail,
even when loaded unevenly and running at a fair
speed round sharp curves. From one point of view,
the gyroscopic car is no more wonderful than a
spinning top, but the spectacle of a vehicle running
steadily on a single rail was so extraordinary that
the interest of the whole world was immediately
aroused. Support was given to Mr Brennan's experiments
by the India Office and the Colonial Office,
on the ground that a railway which required only
one rail, and was more or less independent of both
curves and gradients, would be of great value in
districts where the ordinary two-track railway might
be both inconvenient and too costly. One drawback
to the arrangement is the necessity of fitting each
vehicle with gyroscopes, which are expensive and
delicate pieces of apparatus. But the ingenuity of
the invention is so great that Mr Brennan ought to
reap the reward of seeing a gyroscopic railway in full
operation before long.</p>

</div>
</div>


<p>The only electric mono-railway actually at work is
the 'hanging railway' at Elberfeld in Germany (<a href="#Page_125">Fig.
13</a>). This railway is an evolution from the system of
'telpherage' which was devised in the very infancy
of electric traction for the transport of goods. The
root idea is to make the overhead wire carrying the
current the track rail as well, the whole contrivance&mdash;rails
and cars&mdash;being suspended from girders or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>cables supported by a series of standards or bridges.
At Elberfeld the cars pass over streets and also
over canals. There are no signs, however, that the
'hanging railway' will have any imitators. In
appearance and in cost of construction and operation
it does not seem to have any conspicuous advantages
over a double-track overhead railway. The system
of telpherage is therefore likely to be confined to
the carriage of goods from one part of a factory to
another, and (in the form of cable-ways) to the handling
of materials in mines and other extensive engineering
works. For such purposes it is having an increasingly
extended application.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br /><br />

<small>THE FUTURE</small></h2>


<p>Nothing irritates an electrical engineer more
readily than the repetition of the phrase, 'Electricity
is in its infancy.' The words have been used by
countless mayors and aldermen while 'inaugurating'
tramway or electric lighting schemes; they have been
echoed by innumerable journalists who persist in
maintaining a Jules-Verne attitude towards the
electrical industry. And what disturbs the electrical
engineer is not only the banality of the phrase but
the use of it as a comment upon the achievements
to which he has devoted his life.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it will be admitted, from the rapid
survey which we have taken of electric traction, that
the potentialities of electricity in locomotion make an
even stronger appeal than the actualities. Except
in one field&mdash;the tramway field&mdash;engineers have only
touched the fringe of possible developments in electric
locomotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Even in tramway work we may, if legislative
conditions improve and if current becomes much
cheaper, see a considerable development in passenger
and also in agricultural lines. Meanwhile the trolley
omnibus offers a prospect of extension in electric
road traction; and there is a great deal yet to be
done with petrol-electric vehicles and with electric
automobiles in certain classes of transport.</p>

<p>The great field, however, lies in railway traction.
There are 200 miles of electric railway in the United
Kingdom; and there are nearly 13,000 miles of steam
railway. Not even the most sanguine electrical
missionary will believe that this difference can be
materially altered within the next decade, but there
is ample ground for faith in the steady increase of the
electrical figure. If the advance of electric traction
on railways must be slow, it is because financial and
not engineering considerations govern the speed of
conversion. No railway company can take a step
involving hundreds of thousands of pounds, and a
revolution in working methods, without prolonged
consideration and elaborate preparation.</p>

<p>On roads, on tramways, and on railroads, the
future lies with electricity&mdash;wholly on railroads and
tramways, perhaps not wholly on roads. There is
scope for it also at sea; and if our canals are worth
the cost of reconstruction on modern lines, electric
haulage will be used there on the model of the canal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
haulage installations which exist here and there on
the Continent. For marine work the advantages of
electricity have yet to be confirmed by practical
experience; but on land it has already proved that
it supplies a means of locomotion which is more
efficient, cleaner and more attractive, and more closely
adapted to the needs and distribution of modern
population than any other.</p>

<p>The fashion for devising Utopias is not so popular
as it used to be, but in every ideal world which is
more than a spiritual vision, and in every intelligent
forecast of an advanced civilisation, universal electric
transport is taken for granted. Electrical engineers
are ready to prove that this standard element in
Utopia is available at the present day on the basis
which is the ultimate justification of all engineering
projects in this workaday world&mdash;the basis of profit.</p>

<p>Their confidence will be intensified when we
approach the 'all-electric' age prophesied by Mr
Ferranti in his Presidential Address to the Institution
of Electrical Engineers in 1910. Mr Ferranti
looks forward to a national scheme for the supply
and distribution of electric power. Under this scheme,
the production of electricity would be concentrated
in one hundred huge power stations, using engines of
enormous capacity and acting as wholesale suppliers
of electrical energy to towns, railways, tramways, and
factories. The price of electricity would then be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>fraction of what it is now; and all the economies of
electricity in action would be multiplied accordingly.
Technically, the scheme is quite feasible; and it
could be realised in the near future if capitalists and
the Government could be brought to appreciate the
tremendous stimulus it would offer to industrial
activity and the effect it would have in conserving
the power which is latent in our coal measures.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at
http://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
